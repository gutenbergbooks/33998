<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The hymn lore of the Christian Church offers a fascinating
field for profitable research and study. To know the
hymns of the Church is to know something of the spiritual
strivings and achievements of the people of God throughout
the centuries. Henry Ward Beecher has well said: &ldquo;Hymns
are the jewels which the Church has worn, the pearls, the
diamonds, the precious stones, formed into amulets more
potent against sorrow and sadness than the most famous
charm of the wizard or the magician. And he who knows
the way that hymns flowed, knows where the blood of true
piety ran, and can trace its veins and arteries to the very
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This volume has been inspired by a desire on the part of
the author to create deeper love for the great lyrics of the
Christian Church. In pursuing this purpose an effort has
been made to present such facts and circumstances surrounding
their authorship and composition as will result in a better
understanding and appreciation of the hymns themselves.</p>
<p>A hymn is a child of the age in which it was written.
For this reason the author has followed a chronological
arrangement in an endeavor, not only to set forth the historical
background of the hymns, but also to trace the spiritual
movements within the Church that gave them birth.</p>
<p>The materials contained in this volume have been gathered
from sources too numerous to mention here. The author
feels a special sense of gratitude for information drawn from
David R. Breed&rsquo;s &ldquo;The History and Use of Hymns and
Hymn-Tunes,&rdquo; Edward S. Ninde&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Story of the American
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Hymn,&rdquo; and John Julian&rsquo;s monumental work, &ldquo;Dictionary
of Hymnology.&rdquo; No claim is made to originality,
except in the manner of presentation and interpretation. A
popular style has been adopted in order to appeal to the
lay reader.</p>
<p>Thus we send forth this book with the earnest prayer that
it may inspire many hearts to sing with greater devotion the
praises of Him who redeemed us with His blood and made
us to be kings and priests unto God.</p>

<div id="c1" title="The Early Christian Chants">
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<h3>THE EARLY CHRISTIAN CHANTS</h3>
<p>The first Christians sang hymns. The Saviour went to His passion with a song on His
lips. Matthew and Mark agree that the last act of worship in the Upper Room was the
singing of a hymn. &ldquo;And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the Mount of
Olives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How we wish that the words of that hymn might have been preserved! Perhaps they have.
Many Biblical scholars believe that they may be found in the so-called <i>Hallel</i> series in the
Psaltery, consisting of Psalms 113 to 118 inclusive. It was a practice among the Jews to chant
these holy songs at the paschal table. Fraught as they were with Messianic hope, it was fitting
that such a hymn should ascend to the skies in the hour when God&rsquo;s Paschal Lamb was about
to be offered.</p>
<p>The Christian Church followed the example of Jesus and His disciples by singing from the
Psaltery at its worship. Paul admonished his converts not to neglect the gift of song. To the
Ephesians he wrote: &ldquo;Be filled with the Spirit; speaking one to another in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; And his
exhortation to the Colossians rings like an echo: &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in
all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The praying and singing of Paul and Silas in the midnight gloom of the Philippian dungeon,
their feet being made
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
&ldquo;fast in the stocks,&rdquo; also is a revelation of the large place occupied by song
in the lives of the early Christians.</p>
<p>The double reference of the Apostle to &ldquo;psalms, hymns and spiritual songs&rdquo; would indicate that
the Christian Church very early began to use chants and hymns other than those taken from
the Psaltery. The younger Pliny, in 112 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, wrote to Emperor Trajan from Bithynia that the
Christians came together before daylight and sang hymns alternately (<i>invicem</i>) &ldquo;to Christ as
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These distinctively Christian chants were the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>, or the &ldquo;Angelic Hymn,&rdquo;
so called because its opening lines are taken from the song of the angels at Jesus&rsquo; birth; the
<i>Magnificat</i>, Mary&rsquo;s song of praise; the <i>Benedictus</i>, the song of Zacharias, father of John the
Baptist; and the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>, the prayer of the aged Simeon when he held the Christ-child in
his arms. Other chants that were used very early in the Christian Church included the <i>Ter
Sanctus</i>, based on the &ldquo;thrice holy&rdquo; of Isaiah 6:3 and
Revelation 4:8; the <i>Gloria Patri</i>, or &ldquo;Lesser
Doxology;&rdquo; the <i>Benedicite</i>, the &ldquo;Song of the Three Hebrew Children,&rdquo; from the Apocrypha; and
the <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>, which is sometimes regarded as a later Latin chant, but which
undoubtedly was derived from a very ancient hymn of praise.</p>
<p>Eminent Biblical scholars believe that fragments of other primitive Christian hymns have been
preserved in the Epistles of Paul and in other portions of the New Testament. Such a fragment
is believed to be recorded in 1 Timothy 3:16:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He who was manifested in the flesh,</p>
<p class="t">Justified in the spirit,</p>
<p class="t2">Seen of angels,</p>
<p class="t0">Preached among the nations,</p>
<p class="t">Believed on in the world,</p>
<p class="t2">Received up in glory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The &ldquo;faithful saying&rdquo; to which Paul refers in 2 Timothy 2:11 also is
believed to be a quotation from one of these hymns so dear to the Christians:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If we died with Him,</p>
<p class="t0">We shall also live with Him:</p>
<p class="t0">If we endure,</p>
<p class="t0">We shall also reign with Him:</p>
<p class="t0">If we shall deny Him,</p>
<p class="t0">He will also deny us:</p>
<p class="t0">If we are faithless,</p>
<p class="t0">He abideth faithful;</p>
<p class="t0">For He cannot deny Himself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It will be noted how well these passages adapt themselves to responsive, or antiphonal,
chanting, which was the character of the ancient Christian songs. Other passages that are
believed to be fragments of ancient hymns are Ephesians 5:14;
1 Timothy 6:15, 16; James 1:17,
and Revelation 1:5-7.</p>
<p>There are strong evidences to support the claim that responsive singing in the churches of Asia
Minor was introduced during the latter part of the first century by Ignatius, bishop of Antioch,
a pupil of the Apostle John. The <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> was used in matin services about this
time, while the <i>Magnificat</i> was sung at vespers. Ignatius suffered martyrdom about 107
<span class="small">A.D.</span> by being torn to pieces by lions in the circus as a despiser of the gods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Liturgies also were employed very early in the worship of the Christian Church. An ancient
service known as the &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; liturgy was ascribed to the Apostle James, while the so-called
&ldquo;Alexandrian&rdquo; liturgy claimed as its author Mark, fellow laborer of Paul and companion of
Peter. There is much uncertainty surrounding these claims, however.</p>
<p>Both Tertullian and Origen record the fact that there was a rich use of song in family life as
well as in public worship.</p>
<p>The singing of the early Christians was simple and artless. Augustine describes the singing at
Alexandria under Athanasius as &ldquo;more like speaking than singing.&rdquo; Musical instruments were
not used. The pipe, tabret, and harp were associated so intimately with the sensuous heathen
cults, as well as with the wild revelries and shameless performances of the degenerate theatre
and circus, that it is easy to understand the prejudice against their use in the Christian worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Christian maiden,&rdquo; says Jerome, &ldquo;ought not even to know what a lyre or a flute is, or what it
is used for.&rdquo; Clement of Alexandria writes: &ldquo;Only one instrument do we use, viz., the word of
peace wherewith we honor God, no longer the old psaltery, trumpet, drum, and flute.&rdquo;
Chrysostom expresses himself in like vein: &ldquo;David formerly sang in psalms, also we sing today
with him; he had a lyre with lifeless strings, the Church has a lyre with living strings. Our
tongues are the strings of the lyre, with a different tone, indeed, but with a more accordant
piety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The language of the first Christian hymns, like the language of the New Testament, was Greek.
The Syriac tongue was also used in some regions, but Greek gradually attained ascendancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The hymns of the Eastern Church are rich in adoration and the spirit of worship. Because of
their exalted character and Scriptural language they have found an imperishable place in the
liturgical forms of the Christian Church. As types of true hymnody, they have never been
surpassed.</p>

<div id="c2" title="Greek and Syriac Hymns">
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h3>GREEK AND SYRIAC HYMNS</h3>
<p>Very soon the early Christians began to use hymns other than the Psalms and Scriptural chants.
In other words, they began to sing the praises of the Lord in their own words. Eusebius
informs us that in the first half of the third century there existed a large number of sacred
songs. Some of these have come down to us, but the authorship of only one is known with any
degree of certainty. It is the beautiful children&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Shepherd of Tender Youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just how old this hymn is cannot be stated with certainty. However, it is found appended to a
very ancient Christian work entitled &ldquo;The Tutor,&rdquo; written in Greek by Clement of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Clement, whose real name was Titus Flavius Clemens, was born about 170 <span class="small">A.D.</span> He was one of
the first great scholars in the Christian Church. An eager seeker after truth, he studied the
religions and philosophical systems of the Greeks, the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Jews.</p>
<p>In the course of time he entered the Catechetical School conducted by Pantaenus at Alexandria,
Egypt, and there he became a convert to Christianity. Some years later Clement himself became
the head of the institution, which was the first Christian school of its kind in the world. Among
the students who received instruction from Clement was the famous Origen, who became the
greatest scholar in the ancient Christian church. Another of his pupils was Alexander,
afterwards Bishop of Jerusalem, and still later Bishop of Cappadocia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>One of Clement&rsquo;s most celebrated works was &ldquo;The Tutor.&rdquo; It was in three volumes. The first
book described the Tutor, who is Christ Himself; the second book contained sundry directions
concerning the daily life and conduct; and the third, after dwelling on the nature of true
beauty, condemned extravagance in dress, on the part of both men and women.</p>
<p>Two poems are appended to this work, the first of which is entitled, &ldquo;A Hymn to the Saviour.&rdquo;
This is the hymn known as &ldquo;Shepherd of tender youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Hymn to the Saviour&rdquo; in all the manuscripts in which it is found is attributed to Clement
himself, but some critics believe that he was merely quoting it, and that it was written by a still
earlier poet. Be that as it may, we do know that, aside from the hymns derived from the Bible,
it is the oldest Christian hymn in existence, and it has always been referred to as &ldquo;Clement&rsquo;s
hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clement was driven from Alexandria during the persecution of Severus in 202 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Of his
subsequent history practically nothing is known. It is believed he died about 220 <span class="small">A.D.</span></p>
<p>A number of other beautiful Greek hymns have come down to us from the same period, but
their date and authorship remain in doubt. Longfellow has given us an exquisite translation of
one of these in &ldquo;The Golden Legend&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Gladsome Light</p>
<p class="t0">Of the Father immortal,</p>
<p class="t0">And of the celestial</p>
<p class="t0">Sacred and blessed</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, our Saviour!</p>
<p class="t0">Now to the sunset</p>
<p class="t0">Again hast Thou brought us;</p>
<p class="t0">And seeing the evening</p>
<p class="t0">Twilight, we bless Thee,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p class="t0">Praise Thee, adore Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Father omnipotent!</p>
<p class="t0">Son, the Life-giver!</p>
<p class="t0">Spirit, the Comforter!</p>
<p class="t0">Worthy at all times</p>
<p class="t0">Of worship and wonder!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An inspiring little doxology, also by an unknown author, reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My hope is God,</p>
<p class="t0">My refuge is the Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">My shelter is the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="t0">Be Thou, O Holy Three, adored!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Doctrinal controversies gave the first real impetus to hymn writing in the Eastern church. As
early as the second century, Bardesanes, a Gnostic teacher, had beguiled many to adopt his
heresy by the charm of his hymns and melodies. His son, Harmonius, followed in the father&rsquo;s
footsteps. Their hymns were written in the Syriac language, and only a few fragments have
been preserved.</p>
<p>The Arians and other heretical teachers also seized upon the same method to spread their
doctrines. It was not until the fourth century, apparently, that any effort was made by orthodox
Christians to meet them with their own weapons. Ephrem Syrus, who has been called &ldquo;the
cithern of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; was the greatest teacher of his time in the Syrian Church, as well as
her most gifted hymnist. This unusual man was born in northern Mesopotamia about 307 <span class="small">A.D.</span>
His zeal for orthodox Christianity was no doubt kindled by his presence at the Council of
Nicaea in 325 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, and thenceforth he was ever an eager champion of the faith. Not only did
he write hymns and chants, but he trained large choirs to sing them. He exerted a profound
influence over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
entire Syrian Church, and even today his hymns are used by the Maronite
Christians.</p>
<p>The greatest name among the Greek hymnists of this period is Gregory Nazianzen. Born in 325
<span class="small">A.D.</span>, the son of a bishop, he was compelled by his father to enter the priesthood at the age of
thirty-six years. He labored with much zeal, however, and eventually was enthroned by the
Emperor&rsquo;s own hand as Patriarch of Constantinople. Through the machinations of the Arians
he was later compelled to abdicate his office, whereupon he retired to his birthplace. Here he
spent the last years of his life in writing sacred poetry of singular beauty and lofty spirit.</p>
<p>Another of the important writers of the early Greek period was Anatolius. Concerning this
man very little is known except that he lived in the seventh or eighth century. He has left about
one hundred hymns, among them, at least three that are still in common use, &ldquo;Fierce was the
wild billow,&rdquo; &ldquo;The day is past and over,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A great and mighty wonder.&rdquo; This last is a little
Christmas hymn of unusual charm. His description of the storm of Galilee is one of the classics
of Greek hymnology:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fierce was the wild billow,</p>
<p class="t">Dark was the night;</p>
<p class="t0">Oars labored heavily,</p>
<p class="t">Foam glimmered white;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Trembled the mariners,</p>
<p class="t">Peril was nigh;</p>
<p class="t0">Then said the God of God,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Peace! It is I.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To John of Damascus, who died about 780 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, we are indebted for two of the most popular
Easter hymns in use
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
today, namely, &ldquo;The day of resurrection&rdquo; and &ldquo;Come, ye faithful, raise the
strain.&rdquo; Further reference to these will be found in the chapter on the great translator of Greek
and Latin hymns, John Mason Neale.</p>
<p>When John of Damascus forsook the world and left behind him a brilliant career to enter a
monastery founded in 520 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, by St. Sabas, he took with him his ten-year-old nephew,
Stephen. The boy grew up within the walls of this cloister, which is situated in one of the deep
gorges of the brook Kedron, near Bethlehem, overlooking the Dead Sea. Stephen, who came to
be known as the Sabaite, was likewise a gifted hymnist, and it is he who has given us the hymn
made famous by Neale&rsquo;s translation: &ldquo;Art thou weary, art thou languid?&rdquo; Stephen died in 794
<span class="small">A.D.</span></p>
<p>The last name of importance among the great hymn-writers of the Greek Church is that of
Joseph the Hymnographer, who lived at Constantinople in the ninth century. It is he who
wrote the hymn on angels for St. Michael&rsquo;s Day:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,</p>
<p class="t0">Filled with celestial resplendence and light,</p>
<p class="t0">These that, where night never followeth day,</p>
<p class="t0">Raise the &ldquo;Thrice Holy, Lord!&rdquo; ever and aye.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As early as the fourth century the Council of Laodicea had decreed that &ldquo;besides the appointed
singers, who mount the ambo, and sing from the book, others shall not sing in the church.&rdquo;
How far this rule may have discouraged or suppressed congregational singing is a subject of
dispute among historians. However, it is a matter of record that hymnody suffered a gradual
decline in the Eastern division of the Christian Church and eventually assumed more of a
liturgical character.</p>

<div id="c3" title="The Rise of Latin Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h3>THE RISE OF LATIN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>The first hymns and canticles used in the Western churches came from the East. They were
sung in their original Greek form. It was not until the beginning of the fourth century that any
record of Latin hymns is found. Isadore of Seville, who died in the year 636 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, tells us that
&ldquo;Hilary of Gaul, bishop of Poitiers, was the first who flourished in composing hymns in verse.&rdquo;
Hilary, who died in the year 368, himself records the fact that he brought some of them from
the East. His most famous Latin hymn is <i>Lucis largitor splendide</i>.</p>
<p>The father of Latin hymnody, however, was the great church father, Aurelius Ambrose, bishop
of Milan. It was he who taught the Western Church to glorify God in song. Concerning this
remarkable bishop, Mabillon writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Ambrose took care that, after the manner of the Eastern Fathers, psalms and hymns should
be sung by the people also, when previously they had only been recited by individuals singly,
and among the Italians by clerks only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father of Ambrose was prefect of the Gauls, and it is believed that the future bishop was
born at Treves about 340 <span class="small">A.D.</span> The youthful Ambrose, like his father, was trained for
government service, and in 374 <span class="small">A.D.</span> he was appointed Consular of Liguria and Aemilia.
During the election of a bishop in Milan, a bitter conflict raged between the orthodox
Christians and the Arians, and Ambrose found it necessary to attend the church where the
election was taking place in order to calm the excited assembly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>According to tradition, a child&rsquo;s voice was heard to cry out in the church, &ldquo;Ambrosius!&rdquo; This
was accepted at once by the multitude as an act of divine guidance and the whole assembly
began shouting, &ldquo;Ambrose shall be our bishop!&rdquo; Ambrose had been attracted to the Christian
religion but as yet had not received baptism. He therefore protested his election and
immediately fled from the city. He was induced to return, however, was baptized, and
accepted the high office for which he had been chosen.</p>
<p>The story of his subsequent life is one of the most remarkable chapters in the annals of the
early Christian Church. Selling all his possessions, he entered upon the duties of his bishopric
with such fervent zeal and untiring devotion that his fame spread far and wide. He early recognized
the value of music in church worship and immediately took steps to introduce
congregational singing. He was the author of a new kind of church music, which, because of its
rhythmical accent, rich modulation, and musical flow, made a powerful appeal to the emotions.
Withal, because it was combined with such artless simplicity, it was easily mastered by the
common people and instantly sprang into great popularity. By the introduction of responsive
singing he also succeeded in securing the active participation of the congregation in the
worship.</p>
<p>Empress Justina favored the Arians and sought to induce Ambrose to open the church of Milan
for their use. When Ambrose replied with dignity that it did not behoove the state to interfere
in matters of doctrine, soldiers were sent to enforce the imperial will. The people of Milan,
however, rallied around their beloved bishop, and, when the soldiers surrounded the church,
Ambrose and his congregation were singing and praying. So tremendous was
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the effect of the
song that the soldiers outside the church finally joined in the anthems. The effort to compel
Ambrose to yield proved fruitless, and the empress abandoned her plan.</p>
<p>Augustine, who later became the most famous convert of Ambrose, tells of the great
impression made on his soul when he heard the singing of Ambrose and his congregation. In
his &ldquo;Confessions&rdquo; he writes: &ldquo;How mightily I was moved by the overwhelming tones of Thy
Church, my God! Thy voices flooded my ears, Thy truth melted my heart, the sacred fires of
worship were kindled in my soul, my tears flowed, and a foretaste of the joy of salvation was
given me.&rdquo; Ambrose himself has left us this testimony: &ldquo;They say that people are transported
by the singing of my hymns, and I confess that it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ambrose was no respecter of persons. Although he was a warm friend of the Emperor
Theodosius, he denounced the latter&rsquo;s cruel massacre of the people of Thessalonica, and, when
Theodosius came to the church of Ambrose to worship, he was met at the door by the brave
bishop and denied admittance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;who have been guilty of shedding innocent blood, dare to enter the
sanctuary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emperor for eight months refrained from communion; then he applied for absolution,
which was granted him after he had done public penance. He also promised in the future
never to execute a death sentence within thirty days of its pronouncement.</p>
<p>It was at Milan that the pious Monica experienced the joy of seeing her tears and prayers
answered in the conversion of her famous son, Augustine. The latter, who had come to Milan
in the year 384 as a teacher of oratory,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
was attracted at first by the eloquence of Ambrose&rsquo;s
preaching. It was not long, however, before the Word of God began to grip the heart of the
skeptical, sensual youth. At length he was induced to begin anew the study of the Scripture,
and his conversion followed. It was on Easter Sunday, 387 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, that he received the rite of
holy baptism at the hands of Bishop Ambrose. There is a beautiful tradition that the <i>Te Deum
Laudamus</i> was composed under inspiration and recited alternately by Ambrose and Augustine
immediately after the latter had been baptized. However, there is little to substantiate this
legend, and it is more likely that the magnificent hymn of praise was a compilation of a later
date, based on a very ancient Greek version.</p>
<p>As Athanasius was the defender of the doctrine of the Trinity in the East, so Ambrose was its
champion in the West. It is natural, therefore, that many of the hymns of Ambrose center
around the deity of Christ. There are at least twelve Latin hymns that can be ascribed with
certainty to him. Perhaps his best hymn is <i>Veni, Redemptor gentium</i>, which Luther prized very
highly and which was one of the first he translated into German. The English translation,
&ldquo;Come, Thou Saviour of our race,&rdquo; is by William R. Reynolds. Another Advent hymn, &ldquo;Now
hail we our Redeemer,&rdquo; is sometimes ascribed to Ambrose.</p>
<p>The beloved bishop, whose life had been so stormy, passed peacefully to rest on Easter
evening, 397 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Thus was seemingly granted beautiful fulfilment to the prayer Ambrose
utters in one of his hymns:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Grant to life&rsquo;s day a calm unclouded ending,</p>
<p class="t">An eve untouched by shadows of decay,</p>
<p class="t0">The brightness of a holy deathbed blending</p>
<p class="t">With dawning glories of the eternal day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>While Ambrose was defending the faith and inditing sacred songs at Milan, another
richly-endowed poet was writing sublime Latin verse far to the West. He was Aurelius
Clemens Prudentius, the great Spanish hymnist. Of his personal history we know little except
that he was born 348 <span class="small">A.D.</span> in northern Spain, probably at Saragossa.</p>
<p>In early life he occupied important positions of state, but in his latter years he retired to a
monastery. Here he exercised his high poetic gifts in writing a series of sacred Latin poems. He
was preeminently the poet of the martyrs, never ceasing to extol their Christian faith and
fortitude. Bentley called Prudentius the &ldquo;Horace of the Christians.&rdquo; Rudelbach declared that his
poetry &ldquo;is like gold set with precious stones,&rdquo; and Luther expressed the desire that the works of
Prudentius should be studied in the schools.</p>
<p>The finest funeral hymn ever written has come to us from the pen of this early Spanish bard. It
consists of forty-four verses, and begins with the line, <i>Deus ignee fons animarum</i>. It is sometimes
referred to as the &ldquo;song of the catacombs.&rdquo; Archbishop Trench of England called this hymn &ldquo;the
crowning glory of the poetry of Prudentius,&rdquo; and another archbishop, Johan Olof Wallin, the
great hymnist of Sweden, made four different attempts at translating it before he produced the
hymn now regarded as one of the choicest gems in the &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; of his native land.</p>
<p>An English version, derived from the longer poem, begins with the stanza:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Despair not, O heart, in thy sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">But hope from God&rsquo;s promises borrow;</p>
<p class="t0">Beware, in thy sorrow, of sinning,</p>
<p class="t0">For death is of life the beginning.</p>

<div id="c4" title="An Ancient Singer Who Glorified the Cross">
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<h3>AN ANCIENT SINGER WHO GLORIFIED THE CROSS</h3>
<p>The joyous, rhythmical church-song introduced by Bishop Ambrose made triumphant progress
throughout the Western Church. For three centuries it seems to have completely dominated
the worship. Its rich melodies and native freshness made a strong appeal to the human
emotions, and therefore proved very popular with the people.</p>
<p>However, when Gregory the Great in 590 <span class="small">A.D.</span> ascended the papal chair a reaction had set in.
Many of the Ambrosian hymns and chants had become corrupted and secularized and
therefore had lost their ecclesiastical dignity. Gregory, to whose severe, ascetic nature the
bright and lively style of Ambrosian singing must have seemed almost an abomination,
immediately took steps to reform the church music.</p>
<p>A school of music was founded in Rome where the new Gregorian liturgical style, known as
&ldquo;Cantus Romanus,&rdquo; was taught. The Gregorian music was sung in unison. It was slow, uniform
and measured, without rhythm and beat, and thus it approached the old recitative method of
psalm singing. While it is true that it raised the church music to a higher, nobler and more
dignified level, its fatal defect lay in the fact that it could be rendered worthily only by trained
choirs and singers. Congregational singing soon became a thing of the past. The common
people thenceforth became silent and passive worshipers, and the congregational hymn was
superseded by a clerical liturgy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>One of the last hymnists of the Ambrosian school and the most important Latin poet of the
sixth century was Venantius Fortunatus, bishop of Poitiers. He was born at Ceneda, near
Treviso, about 530 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, and was converted to Christianity at an early age. While a student at
Ravenna he almost became blind. Having regained his sight through what he regarded a
miracle, he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Martin at Tours, and as a result of this
journey the remainder of his life was spent in Gaul.</p>
<p>Although all of the poetry of Fortunatus is not of the highest order, he has bequeathed some
magnificent hymns to the Christian Church. No one has ever sung of the Cross with such deep
pathos and sublime tenderness:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Faithful Cross! above all other,</p>
<p class="t">One and only noble tree!</p>
<p class="t0">None in foliage, none in blossom,</p>
<p class="t">None in fruit thy peer may be;</p>
<p class="t0">Sweetest wood and sweetest iron!</p>
<p class="t">Sweetest weight is hung on thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bend thy boughs, O Tree of Glory!</p>
<p class="t">Thy relaxing sinews bend;</p>
<p class="t0">For awhile the ancient rigor</p>
<p class="t">That thy birth bestowed, suspend;</p>
<p class="t0">And the King of heavenly beauty</p>
<p class="t">On thy bosom gently tend!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou alone wast counted worthy</p>
<p class="t">This world&rsquo;s Ransom to uphold;</p>
<p class="t0">For a shipwrecked race preparing</p>
<p class="t">Harbor, like the Ark of old;</p>
<p class="t0">With the sacred blood anointed</p>
<p class="t">From the smitten Lamb that rolled.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>And again:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Tree of beauty, Tree of Light!</p>
<p class="t0">O Tree with royal purple dight!</p>
<p class="t0">Elect on whose triumphal breast</p>
<p class="t0">Those holy limbs should find their rest:</p>
<p class="t0">On whose dear arms, so widely flung,</p>
<p class="t0">The weight of this world&rsquo;s Ransom hung:</p>
<p class="t0">The price of humankind to pay,</p>
<p class="t0">And spoil the spoiler of his prey.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fortunatus&rsquo; famous Passion hymn, <i>Pange lingua glorioso</i>,
is also the basis for the beautiful Easter hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Praise the Saviour</p>
<p class="t">Now and ever!</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him all beneath the skies!</p>
<p class="t">Prostrate lying,</p>
<p class="t">Suffering, dying,</p>
<p class="t0">On the Cross, a Sacrifice;</p>
<p class="t">Victory gaining,</p>
<p class="t">Life obtaining,</p>
<p class="t0">Now in glory He doth rise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another Easter hymn, &ldquo;Welcome, happy morning! age to age shall say,&rdquo; has a triumphant ring
in its flowing lines. His odes to Ascension day and Whitsunday are similar in character.</p>
<p>That Fortunatus had a true evangelical conception of Christ and His atonement may be seen in
his well-known hymn, <i>Lustra sex qui jam peregit</i>:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy Jesus, grant us grace</p>
<p class="t0">In Thy sacrifice to place</p>
<p class="t0">All our trust for life renewed,</p>
<p class="t0">Pardoned sin and promised good.</p>

<div id="c5" title="The Golden Age of Latin Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h3>THE GOLDEN AGE OF LATIN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>During the Middle Ages, when evil days had fallen upon the Church, there was very little to
inspire sacred song. All over Europe the Gregorian chants, sung in Latin, had crowded out
congregational singing. The barbarian languages were considered too crude for use in
worship, and much less were they regarded as worthy of being moulded into Christian hymns.
Religious poetry was almost invariably written in Latin.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of the spiritual decay and worldly depravity that characterized the age
there were noble souls whose lives shone like bright stars in the surrounding darkness. Their
sacred poetry, a great deal of which was written for private devotion, bears witness of their
deep love for the Saviour.</p>
<p>The beautiful Palm Sunday hymn, &ldquo;All glory, laud, and honor,&rdquo; was composed by Bishop
Theodulph of Orleans in a prison cell, probably in the year 821. The immortal <i>Veni, Creator
Spiritus</i> also dates from the same period, being usually ascribed to Rhabanus Maurus,
archbishop of Mainz, who died in the year 856.</p>
<p>The religious fervor inspired by the Crusades, which began in the year 1098, resulted in the
production during the twelfth century of Latin poetry of singular lyrical beauty. This may be
regarded as the golden age of Latin hymnody.</p>
<p>It was during this period that the most touching of all Good Friday hymns, &ldquo;O sacred Head,
now wounded,&rdquo; was
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
written. It is ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux, preacher of the Second
Crusade, and one of the most brilliant of Latin hymn-writers.</p>
<p>Although composed in the twelfth century, the hymn did not achieve unusual fame until five
centuries later, when it was rendered into German by the greatest of all Lutheran hymnists,
Paul Gerhardt. Lauxmann has well said: &ldquo;Bernard&rsquo;s original is powerful and searching, but
Gerhardt&rsquo;s hymn is still more powerful and profound, as re-drawn from the deeper spring of
evangelical Lutheran, Scriptural knowledge and fervency of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerhardt&rsquo;s version in turn was translated into English by James W. Alexander of Princeton, a
Presbyterian. Thus, as Dr. Philip Schaff puts it: &ldquo;This classic hymn has shown in three
tongues&mdash;Latin, German and English&mdash;and in three confessions&mdash;Roman, Lutheran and Reformed&mdash;with
equal effect the dying love of our Saviour and our boundless indebtedness to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet another Lutheran, none other than John Sebastian Bach, &ldquo;high priest of church music,&rdquo;
has contributed to the fame of the hymn by giving the gripping tune to which it is sung its
present form. Strangely enough, this remarkable minor melody was originally a rather
frivolous German folksong, and was adapted by Hans Leo Hassler in 1601 to the hymn,
&ldquo;Herzlich thut mich verlangen.&rdquo; It was Bach, however, who moulded the tune into the &ldquo;Passion
Chorale,&rdquo; one of the world&rsquo;s masterpieces of sacred music.</p>
<p>Many touching stories have been recorded concerning this famous hymn. In 1798, when
Christian Schwartz, the great Lutheran missionary to India, lay dying, his Indian pupils
gathered around his bed and sang in their own Malabar tongue
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the last verses of the hymn,
Schwartz himself joining in the singing till his voice was silenced in death.</p>
<p>Of Bernard of Clairvaux, the writer of the hymn, volumes might be written. Luther paid him an
eloquent tribute, when he said: &ldquo;If there has ever been a pious monk who feared God it was
St. Bernard, whom alone I hold in much higher esteem than all other monks and priests
throughout the globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably no preacher ever exerted a more profound influence over the age in which he lived
than did this Cistercian monk. It was the death of his mother, when he was twenty years old,
that seemed to have been the turning point in his life. The son of a Burgundian knight, he had
planned to become a priest, but now he determined to enter a monastery. He did not go alone,
however, but took with him twelve companions, including an uncle and four of his five
brothers!</p>
<p>When he was only twenty-four years old, in the year 1115, he founded a monastery of his own,
which was destined to become one of the most famous in history. It was situated in a valley in
France called Wormwood, a wild region famous as a robber haunt. Bernard changed the name
to &ldquo;Clara Vallis,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Beautiful Valley,&rdquo; from which is derived the designation &ldquo;Clairvaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among his pupils were men who afterwards wielded great influence in the Roman Church.
One became a pope, six became cardinals, and thirty were elevated to the office of bishop in
the church.</p>
<p>As abbot of Clairvaux, the fame of Bernard spread through all Christendom. He led such an
ascetic life that he was reduced almost to a living skeleton. His haggard appearance alone
made a deep impression on his audiences.
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
But he also was gifted with extraordinary eloquence
and deep spiritual fervor.</p>
<p>Frequently he would leave his monastery to appear before kings and church councils, always
swaying them at will. During the year 1146 he traveled through France and Germany,
preaching a second crusade. The effect of his preaching was almost miraculous. In some
instances the whole population of cities and villages seemed to rise <i>en masse</i>, flocking to the
crusade standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the towns where I have preached,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;scarcely one man is left to seven women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emperor Conrad and Louis, King of France, were easily won to the cause, and in 1147 the vast
horde of crusaders started for the Holy Land. Probably only one-tenth reached Palestine, and
the expedition resulted in failure. A miserable remnant returned home, defeated and
disgraced. The blame was thrown on Bernard and it was no doubt this sorrow that hastened
his death, in the year 1153.</p>
<p>His noble Good Friday hymn, which in Latin begins with the words, <i>Salve caput cruentatum</i>,
alone would have gained undying fame for Bernard, but we are indebted to this gifted monk
for another remarkable poem, <i>De Nomine Jesu</i>, from which at least three of our most beautiful
English hymns have been derived. One of these is a translation by the Englishman, Edward
Caswall:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, the very thought of Thee</p>
<p class="t">With sweetness fills my breast;</p>
<p class="t0">But sweeter far Thy face to see</p>
<p class="t">And in Thy presence rest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A second by the same translator is equally beautiful:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Jesus! King most wonderful,</p>
<p class="t">Thou Conqueror renowned,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou sweetness most ineffable,</p>
<p class="t">In whom all joys are found.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The third derived from Bernard&rsquo;s Latin lyric is by the American hymnist, Ray Palmer:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Jesus, Joy of loving hearts!</p>
<p class="t">Thou Fount of life! Thou Light of men!</p>
<p class="t0">From fullest bliss that earth imparts,</p>
<p class="t">We turn unfilled to Thee again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Throughout the Middle Ages the verses of Bernard were a source of inspiration to faithful
souls, and it is said that even the Crusaders who kept guard over the holy sepulchre at
Jerusalem sang his <i>De Nomine Jesu</i>.</p>
<p>A noted contemporary, Bernard of Cluny, shares with Bernard of Clairvaux the distinction of
occupying the foremost place among the great Latin hymn-writers. This Bernard was born in
Morlaix in Brittany of English parents very early in the twelfth century. After having entered
the Abbey of Cluny, which at that time was the most wealthy and luxurious monastery in
Europe, he devoted his leisure hours to writing his famous poem, <i>De contemptu mundi</i>. This
poem, which is a satire against the vices and follies of his age, contains 3,000 lines. From this
poem have been derived three glorious hymns&mdash;&ldquo;Jerusalem the golden,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brief life is here our
portion,&rdquo; and &ldquo;For thee, O dear, dear country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other noted Latin hymn-writers who followed the two Bernards included Thomas of Celano
who, in the thirteenth century, wrote the masterpiece among judgment hymns, <i>Dies irae, dies
illa</i>, of which Walter Scott has given us the English
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
version, &ldquo;That day of wrath, that dreadful
day&rdquo;; Adam of St. Victor, who was the composer of more than one hundred sequences of high
lyrical order; Jacobus de Benedictis, who is thought to be the writer of <i>Stabat mater dolorosa</i>, the
pathetic Good Friday hymn which in its adapted form is known as &ldquo;Near the cross was Mary
weeping&rdquo;; and Thomas Aquinas, who was the author of <i>Lauda, Sion, salvatorem</i>, a glorious
hymn of praise. With these writers the age of Latin hymnody is brought to a close.</p>

</div>
<div id="c6" title="Martin Luther, Father of Evangelical Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h3>MARTIN LUTHER, FATHER OF EVANGELICAL HYMNODY</h3>
<p>The father of evangelical hymnody was Martin Luther. It was through the efforts of the great
Reformer that the lost art of congregational singing was restored and the Christian hymn again
was given a place in public worship.</p>
<p>Luther was an extraordinary man. To defy the most powerful ecclesiastical hierarchy the world
has known, to bring about a cataclysmic upheaval in the religious and political world, and to
set spiritual forces into motion that have changed the course of human history&mdash;this would
have been sufficient to have gained for him undying fame. But those who know Luther only as
a Reformer know very little about the versatile gifts and remarkable achievements of this great
prophet of the Church.</p>
<p>Philip Schaff has characterized Luther as &ldquo;the Ambrose of German hymnody,&rdquo; and adds: &ldquo;To
Luther belongs the extraordinary merit of having given to the German people in their own
tongue the Bible, the Catechism, and the hymn book, so that God might speak <i>directly</i> to them
in His word, and that they might <i>directly</i> answer Him in their songs.&rdquo; He also refers to him as
&ldquo;the father of the modern High German language and literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther was divinely endowed for his great mission. From childhood he was passionately fond
of music. As a student at Magdeburg, and later at Eisenach, he sang for alms at the windows of
wealthy citizens. It was the sweet voice of the boy that attracted the attention of Ursula Cotta and
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
moved that benevolent woman to give him a home during his school days.</p>
<p>The flute and lute were his favorite instruments, and he used the latter always in
accompanying his own singing. John Walther, a contemporary composer who later aided
Luther in the writing of church music, has left us this testimony: &ldquo;It is to my certain knowledge
that that holy man of God, Luther, prophet and apostle to the German nation, took great
delight in music, both in choral and figural composition. I spent many a delightful hour with
him in singing; and ofttimes I have seen the dear man wax so happy and merry in heart over
the singing that it is well-nigh impossible to weary or content him therewithal. And his discourse
concerning music was most noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Discourse in Praise of Music,&rdquo; Luther gives thanks to God for having bestowed the
power of song on the &ldquo;nightingale and the many thousand birds of the air,&rdquo; and again he
writes, &ldquo;I give music the highest and most honorable place; and every one knows how David
and all the saints put their divine thoughts into verse, rhyme, and song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther had little patience with the iconoclasts of his day. He wrote in the Preface to Walther&rsquo;s
collection of hymns, in 1525: &ldquo;I am not of the opinion that all sciences should be beaten down
and made to cease by the Gospel, as some fanatics pretend, but I would fain see all the arts, and
music, in particular, used in the service of Him who hath given and created them.&rdquo; At another
time he was even more emphatic: &ldquo;If any man despises music, as all fanatics do, for him I have
no liking; for music is a gift and grace of God, not an invention of men. Thus it drives out the
devil and makes people cheerful. Then one forgets all wrath, impurity, sycophancy, and other
vices.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Luther loved the Latin hymns that glorified Christ. He recognized, however, that they were so
permeated with Mariolatry and other errors of the Roman Church that a refining process was
necessary in order to rid them of their dross and permit the fine gold to appear. Moreover, the
Latin hymns, even in their most glorious development, had not grown out of the spiritual life
of the congregation. The very genius of the Roman Church precluded this, for church music
and song was regarded as belonging exclusively to the priestly office. Moreover, since the
entire worship was conducted in Latin, the congregation was inevitably doomed to passive
silence.</p>
<p>Brave efforts by John Huss and his followers to introduce congregational singing in the
Bohemian churches had been sternly opposed by the Roman hierarchy. The Council of
Constance, which in 1415 burned the heroic Huss at the stake, also sent a solemn warning to
Jacob of Misi, his successor as leader of the Hussites, to cease the practice of singing hymns in
the churches. It decreed: &ldquo;If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much
more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s ringing declaration that all believers constitute a universal priesthood necessarily
implied that the laity should also participate in the worship. Congregational singing therefore
became inevitable.</p>
<p>Luther also realized that spiritual song could be enlisted as a powerful ally in spreading the
evangelical doctrines. During the birth throes of the Reformation he often expressed the wish
that someone more gifted than himself might give to the German people in their own language
some of the beautiful pearls of Latin hymnody. He also wanted
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
original hymns in the
vernacular, as well as strong, majestic chorales that would reflect the heroic spirit of the age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lack German poets and musicians,&rdquo; he complained, &ldquo;or they are unknown to us, who are
able to make Christian and spiritual songs of such value that they can be used daily in the
house of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then something happened that opened the fountains of song in Luther&rsquo;s own bosom. The
Reformation had spread from Germany into other parts of Europe, and the Catholic authorities
had commenced to adopt stern measures in an effort to stem the revolt. In the Augustinian
cloister at Antwerp, the prior of the abbey and two youths, Heinrich Voes and Johannes Esch,
had been sentenced to death by the Inquisition for their refusal to surrender their new-born
faith.</p>
<p>The prior was choked to death in his prison cell. The two youths were led to the stake at
Brussels, on July 1, 1523. Before the faggots were kindled they were told that they might still be
freed if they would recant. They replied that they would rather die and be with Christ. Before
the fire and smoke smothered their voices, they sang the ancient Latin hymn, &ldquo;Lord God, we
praise thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When news of the Brussels tragedy reached Luther the poetic spark in his soul burst into full
flame. Immediately he sat down and wrote a festival hymn commemorating the death of the
first Lutheran martyrs. It had been reported to Luther that when the fires began to lick the feet
of Voes, witnesses had heard him exclaim, &ldquo;Behold, blooming roses are strewn around me.&rdquo;
Luther seized upon the words as prophetic and concluded his hymn with the lines:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Summer is even at the door,</p>
<p class="t">The winter now hath vanished,</p>
<p class="t0">The tender flowerets spring once more,</p>
<p class="t">And He who winter banished</p>
<p class="t2">Will send a happy summer.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The opening words of the hymn are also significant, &ldquo;Ein neues Lied wir heben an.&rdquo; Although
the poem must be regarded as more of a ballad than a church hymn, Luther&rsquo;s lyre was tuned,
the springtime of evangelical hymnody was indeed come, and before another year had passed
a little hymn-book called &ldquo;The Achtliederbuch&rdquo; appeared as the first-fruits.</p>
<p>It was in 1524 that this first Protestant hymnal was published. It contained only eight hymns,
four by Luther, three by Speratus, and one probably by Justus Jonas. The little hymn-books
flew all over Europe, to the consternation of the Romanists. Luther&rsquo;s enemies lamented that
&ldquo;the whole people are singing themselves into his doctrines.&rdquo; So great was the demand for
hymns that a second volume known as the &ldquo;Erfurt Enchiridion&rdquo; was published in the same
year. This contained twenty-five hymns, eighteen of which were Luther&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The nightingale of
Wittenberg&rdquo; had begun to sing.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of evangelical hymnody, which was to play so large a part in the
spread of Luther&rsquo;s teachings. The number of hymn-books by other compilers increased rapidly
and so many unauthorized changes were made in his hymns by critical editors that Luther was
moved to complain of their practice.
In a preface to a hymn-book printed by Joseph Klug of Wittenberg, in 1543, Luther writes: &ldquo;I
am fearful that it will fare with this little book as it has ever fared with good books, namely,
that through
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
tampering by incompetent hands it may get to be so overlaid and spoiled that the
good will be lost out of it, and nothing kept in use but the worthless.&rdquo; Then he adds, naively:
&ldquo;Every man may make a hymn-book for himself and let ours alone and not add thereto, as we
here beg, wish and assert. For we desire to keep our own coin up to our own standard,
preventing no one from making better hymns for himself. Now let God&rsquo;s name alone be
praised and our name not sought. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the thirty-six hymns attributed to Luther none has achieved such fame as &ldquo;A mighty fortress
is our God.&rdquo; It has been translated into practically every language and is regarded as one of the
noblest and most classical examples of Christian hymnody. Not only did it become the battle
hymn of the Reformation, but it may be regarded as the true national hymn of Germany. Heine
called it &ldquo;the Marseillaise of the Reformation.&rdquo; Frederick the Great referred to it as &ldquo;God
Almighty&rsquo;s grenadier march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The date of the hymn cannot be fixed with any certainty. Much has been written on the subject,
but none of the arguments appear conclusive. D&rsquo;Aubign&eacute;&rsquo;s unqualified statement that Luther
composed it and sang it to revive the spirits of his friends at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 can
scarcely be accepted, since it appeared at least a year earlier in a hymn-book published by
Joseph Klug.</p>
<p>The magnificent chorale to which the hymn is sung is also Luther&rsquo;s work. Never have words
and music been combined to make so tremendous an appeal. Great musical composers have
turned to its stirring theme again and again when they have sought to produce a mighty effect.
Mendelssohn has used it in the last movement of his Reformation symphony; Meyerbeer uses
it to good advantage in his masterpiece, &ldquo;Les
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Huguenots&rdquo;; and Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kaisermarsch,&rdquo;
written to celebrate the triumphal return of the German troops in 1870, reaches a great climax
with the whole orchestra thundering forth the sublime chorale. Bach has woven it into a
beautiful cantata, while Raff and Nicolai make use of it in overtures.</p>
<p>After Luther&rsquo;s death, when Melanchthon and his friends were compelled to flee from
Wittenberg by the approach of the Spanish army, they came to Weimar. As they were entering
the city, they heard a little girl singing Luther&rsquo;s great hymn. &ldquo;Sing on, my child,&rdquo; exclaimed
Melanchthon, &ldquo;thou little knowest how thy song cheers our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Gustavus Adolphus, the hero king of Sweden, faced Tilly&rsquo;s hosts at the battlefield of
Leipzig, Sept. 7, 1631, he led his army in singing &ldquo;Ein feste Burg.&rdquo; Then shouting, &ldquo;God is with
us,&rdquo; he went into battle. It was a bloody fray. Tilly fell and his army was beaten. When the
battle was over, Gustavus Adolphus knelt upon the ground among his soldiers and thanked
the Lord of Hosts for victory, saying, &ldquo;He holds the field forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War a Swedish trumpeter captured the ensign of the
Imperial army. Pursued by the enemy he found himself trapped with a swollen river before
him. He paused for a moment and prayed, &ldquo;Help me, O my God,&rdquo; and then thrust spurs into
his horse and plunged into the midst of the current. The Imperialists were afraid to follow him,
whereupon he raised his trumpet to his lips and sounded the defiant notes: &ldquo;A mighty fortress
is our God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>George N. Anderson, a missionary in Tanganyika Province, British East Africa, tells how he
once heard an assembly of 2,000 natives sing Luther&rsquo;s great hymn. &ldquo;I never
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
heard it sung with
more spirit; the effect was almost overwhelming,&rdquo; he testifies.</p>
<p>A West African missionary, Christaller, relates how he once sang &ldquo;Ein feste Burg&rdquo; to his native
interpreter. &ldquo;That man, Luther,&rdquo; said the African, &ldquo;must have been a powerful man, one can feel
it in his hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle&rsquo;s estimate of &ldquo;Ein feste Burg&rdquo; seems to accord with that of the African native.
&ldquo;It jars upon our ears,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;yet there is something in it like the sound of Alpine
avalanches, or the first murmur of earthquakes, in the very vastness of which dissonance a
higher unison is revealed to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlyle, who refers to Luther as &ldquo;perhaps the most inspired of all teachers since the Apostles,&rdquo;
has given us the most rugged of all translations of the Reformer&rsquo;s great hymn. There are said to
be no less than eighty English translations, but only a few have met with popular favor. In
England the version by Carlyle is in general use, while in America various composite
translations are found in hymn-books. Carlyle&rsquo;s first stanza reads</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A sure stronghold our God is He,</p>
<p class="t">A trusty Shield and Weapon;</p>
<p class="t0">Our help He&rsquo;ll be, and set us free</p>
<p class="t">From every ill can happen.</p>
<p class="t2">That old malicious foe</p>
<p class="t2">Intends us deadly woe;</p>
<p class="t2">Arm&eacute;d with might from hell</p>
<p class="t2">And deepest craft as well,</p>
<p class="t">On earth is not his fellow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The greater number of Luther&rsquo;s hymns are not original. Many are paraphrases of Scripture,
particularly the Psalms, and others are based on Latin, Greek, and German antecedents.
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
In every instance, however, the great Reformer so imbued them with his own fervent faith and
militant spirit that they seem to shine with a new luster.</p>
<p>The hymns of Luther most frequently found in hymn-books today are &ldquo;Come, Thou Saviour of
our race,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good news from heaven the angels bring,&rdquo; &ldquo;In death&rsquo;s strong grasp the Saviour lay,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, Holy Spirit, from above,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, keep us steadfast
in Thy word,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, Jesus Christ, to Thee we pray,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear Christians, one and all rejoice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Out
of the depths I cry to Thee,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We all believe in one true God.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h3>THE HYMN-WRITERS OF THE REFORMATION</h3>
<p>The hymns of the Reformation were like a trumpet call, proclaiming to all the world that the
day of spiritual emancipation had come. What they lacked in poetic refinement they more than
made up by their tremendous earnestness and spiritual exuberance.</p>
<p>They faithfully reflect the spirit of the age in which they were born, a period of strife and
conflict. The strident note that often appears in Luther&rsquo;s hymns can easily be understood when
it is remembered that the great Reformer looked upon the pope as Antichrist himself and all
others who opposed the Lutheran teachings as confederates of the devil.</p>
<p>In 1541, when the Turkish invasion from the East threatened to devastate all Europe, special
days of humiliation and prayer were held throughout Germany. It was for one of these
occasions that Luther wrote the hymn, &ldquo;Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy word.&rdquo; In its original
form, however, it was quite different from the hymn we now sing. The first stanza ran:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, keep us in Thy word and work,</p>
<p class="t0">Restrain the murderous pope and Turk,</p>
<p class="t0">Who fain would tear from off Thy throne</p>
<p class="t0">Christ Jesus, Thy beloved Son.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When Luther, on the other hand, sang of God&rsquo;s free grace to men in Christ Jesus, or extolled the
merits of the Saviour, or gave thanks for the word of God restored to men, there was such a
marvelous blending of childlike trust,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
victorious faith and spontaneous joy that all Germany was thrilled by the message.</p>
<p>The popularity of the Lutheran hymns was astonishing. Other hymn-writers sprang up in large
numbers, printing presses were kept busy, and before Luther&rsquo;s death no less than sixty
collections of hymns had been published. Wandering evangelists were often surrounded by
excited crowds in the market places, hymns printed on leaflets were distributed, and the whole
populace would join in singing the songs of the Reformers.</p>
<p>Paul Speratus, Paul Eber, and Justus Jonas were the most gifted co-laborers of Luther. It was
Speratus who contributed three hymns to the &ldquo;Achtliederbuch,&rdquo; the first hymn-book published
by Luther. His most famous hymn, &ldquo;To us salvation now is come,&rdquo; has been called &ldquo;the poetic
counterpart of Luther&rsquo;s preface to the Epistle to the Romans.&rdquo; It was the great confessional
hymn of the Reformation. Luther is said to have wept tears of joy when he heard it sung by a
street singer outside his window in Wittenberg.</p>
<p>Speratus wrote the hymn in a Moravian prison into which he had been cast because of his bold
espousal of the Lutheran teachings. Immediately upon his release he proceeded to Wittenberg,
where he joined himself to the Reformers. He later became the leader of the Reformation
movement in Prussia and before his death in 1551 was chosen bishop of Pomerania. His poetic
genius may be seen reflected in the beautiful paraphrase of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer which forms the
concluding two stanzas of his celebrated hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All blessing, honor, thanks, and praise</p>
<p class="t">To Father, Son, and Spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">The God who saved us by His grace,</p>
<p class="t">All glory to His merit:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p class="t0">O Father in the heavens above,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy glorious works show forth Thy love,</p>
<p class="t">Thy worthy Name be hallowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done</p>
<p class="t">In earth, as &rsquo;tis in heaven:</p>
<p class="t0">Keep us in life, by grace led on,</p>
<p class="t">Forgiving and forgiven;</p>
<p class="t0">Save Thou us in temptation&rsquo;s hour,</p>
<p class="t0">And from all ills; Thine is the power,</p>
<p class="t">And all the glory, Amen!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Eber was the sweetest singer among the Reformers. As professor of Hebrew at Wittenberg
University and assistant to Melanchthon, he had an active part in the stirring events of the
Reformation. He possessed more of Melanchthon&rsquo;s gentleness than Luther&rsquo;s ruggedness, and
his hymns are tender and appealing in their childlike simplicity. There is wondrous
consolation in his hymns for the dying, as witness his pious swan-song:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In Thy dear wounds I fall asleep,</p>
<p class="t">O Jesus, cleanse my soul from sin:</p>
<p class="t0">Thy bitter death, Thy precious blood</p>
<p class="t">For me eternal glory win.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">By Thee redeemed, I have no fear,</p>
<p class="t">When now I leave this mortal clay,</p>
<p class="t0">With joy before Thy throne I come;</p>
<p class="t">God&rsquo;s own must die, yet live alway.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Welcome, O death! thou bringest me</p>
<p class="t">To dwell with God eternally;</p>
<p class="t0">Through Christ my soul from sin is free,</p>
<p class="t">O take me now, dear Lord, to Thee!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Another hymn for the dying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus Christ, true man and God,&rdquo; breathes the same spirit of
hope and trust in Christ. During the years of persecution and suffering that followed the
Reformation, the Protestants found much comfort in singing Eber&rsquo;s &ldquo;When in the hour of
utmost need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justus Jonas, the bosom friend of Luther who spoke the last words of peace and consolation to
the dying Reformer and who also preached his funeral sermon, has left us the hymn, &ldquo;If God
were not upon our side,&rdquo; based on Psalm 124.</p>
<p>From this period we also have the beautiful morning hymn, &ldquo;My inmost heart now raises,&rdquo; by
Johannes Mathesius, the pupil and biographer of Luther, and an equally beautiful evening
hymn, &ldquo;Sunk is the sun&rsquo;s last beam of light,&rdquo; by Nicholas Hermann. Mathesius was pastor of the
church at Joachimsthal, in Bohemia, and Hermann was his organist and choirmaster. It is said
that whenever Mathesius preached a particularly good sermon, Hermann was forthwith
inspired to write a hymn on its theme! He was a poet and musician of no mean ability, and his
tunes are among the best from the Reformation period.</p>
<p>The example of the Wittenberg hymnists was quickly followed by evangelicals in other parts of
Germany, and hymn-books began to appear everywhere. As early as 1526 a little volume of
hymns was published at Rostock in the Platt-Deutsch dialect. In this collection we find one of
the most glorious hymns of the Reformation, &ldquo;All glory be to Thee, Most High,&rdquo; or, as it has
also been rendered, &ldquo;All glory be to God on high,&rdquo; a metrical version of the ancient canticle,
<i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>. Five years later another edition
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
was published in which appeared a metrical rendering of <i>Agnus Dei</i>:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lamb of God, most holy,</p>
<p class="t">On Calvary an offering;</p>
<p class="t0">Despis&eacute;d, meek, and, lowly,</p>
<p class="t">Thou in Thy death and suffering</p>
<p class="t0">Our sins didst bear, our anguish;</p>
<p class="t0">The might of death didst vanquish;</p>
<p class="t">Give us Thy peace, O Jesus!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The author of both of these gems of evangelical hymnody was Nicolaus Decius, a Catholic
monk in the cloister of Steterburg who embraced the Lutheran teachings. He later became
pastor of St. Nicholas church in Stettin, where he died under suspicious circumstances in 1541.
In addition to being a popular preacher and gifted poet, he also seems to have been a musician
of some note. The two magnificent chorals to which his hymns are sung are generally credited
to him, although there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding their composition. Luther
prized both hymns very highly and included them in his German liturgy.</p>

</div>
<div id="c8" title="Hymnody of the Controversial Period">
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h3>HYMNODY OF THE CONTROVERSIAL PERIOD</h3>
<p>Many of our great Christian hymns were born in troublous times. This is true in a very special
sense of the hymns written by Nicolaus Selnecker, German preacher and theologian. The age in
which he lived was the period immediately following the Reformation. It was an age marked
by doctrinal controversy, not only with the Romanists, but among the Protestants themselves.
In these theological struggles, Selnecker will always be remembered as one of the great
champions of pure Lutheran doctrine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Formula of Concord,&rdquo; the last of the Lutheran confessions, was largely the work of
Selnecker. Published in 1577, it did more than any other single document to clarify the
Lutheran position on many disputed doctrinal points, thus bringing to an end much of the
confusion and controversy that had existed up to that time.</p>
<p>Selnecker early in life revealed an artistic temperament. Born in 1532 at Hersbruck, Germany,
we find him at the age of twelve years organist at the chapel in the Kaiserburg, at N&uuml;rnberg,
where he attended school. Later he entered Wittenberg University to study law. Here he came
under the influence of Philip Melanchthon, and was induced to prepare himself for the
ministry. It is said that Selnecker was Melanchthon&rsquo;s favorite pupil.</p>
<p>Following his graduation from Wittenberg, he lectured for a while at the university and then
received the appointment
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
as second court preacher at Dresden and private tutor to Prince
Alexander of Saxony. Many of the Saxon theologians at this time were leaning strongly toward
the Calvinistic teaching regarding the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and when Selnecker came out boldly for
the Lutheran doctrine he incurred the hostility of those in authority. Later, when he supported
a Lutheran pastor who had dared to preach against Elector August&rsquo;s passion for hunting, he
was compelled to leave Dresden.</p>
<p>For three years he held the office of professor of theology at the University of Jena, but in 1568
he again found favor with the Elector August and was appointed to the chair of theology in the
University of Leipzig. It was here that Selnecker again became involved in bitter doctrinal
disputes regarding the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and in 1576 and 1577 he joined a group of theologians,
including Jacob Andreae and Martin Chemnitz, in working out the Formula of Concord.</p>
<p>Upon the death of Elector August the Calvinists again secured ecclesiastical control, and
Selnecker once more was compelled to leave Leipzig. After many trials and vicissitudes, he
finally returned, May 19, 1592, a worn and weary man, only to die in Leipzig five days later.</p>
<p>During the stormy days of his life, Selnecker often sought solace in musical and poetical
pursuits. Many of his hymns reflect his own personal troubles and conflicts. &ldquo;Let me be thine
forever&rdquo; is believed to have been written during one of the more grievous experiences of his
life. It was a prayer of one stanza originally, but two additional stanzas were added by an
unknown author almost a hundred years after Selnecker&rsquo;s death. In its present form it has
become a favorite confirmation hymn in the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>Selnecker&rsquo;s zeal for his Church is revealed in many of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
hymns, among them the famous
&ldquo;Abide with us, O Saviour dear.&rdquo; The second stanza of this hymn clearly reflects the distressing
controversies in which he was engaged at the time:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This is a dark and evil day,</p>
<p class="t0">Forsake us not, O Lord, we pray;</p>
<p class="t0">And let us in our grief and pain</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Word and sacraments retain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In connection with his work as professor in the University of Leipzig, he also served as pastor
of the famous St. Thomas church in that city. It was through his efforts that the renowned
Motett choir of that church was built up, a choir that was afterward conducted by John
Sebastian Bach.</p>
<p>About 150 hymns in all were written by Selnecker. In addition to these he also was author of
some 175 theological and controversial works.</p>
<p>One of the contemporaries of Selnecker was Bartholom&auml;us Ringwalt, pastor of Langfeld, near
Sonnenburg, Brandenburg. This man also was a staunch Lutheran and a poet of considerable
ability. His judgment hymn, &ldquo;The day is surely drawing near,&rdquo; seems to reflect the feeling held
by many in those distressing times that the Last Day was near at hand. It was used to a large
extent during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and is still found in many hymn-books.</p>
<p>Another hymnist who lived and wrought during these turbulent times was Martin Behm, to
whom we are indebted for three beautiful lyrics, &ldquo;O Jesus, King of glory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord Jesus Christ,
my Life, my Light,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O holy, blessed Trinity.&rdquo; Behm, who was born in Lauban, Silesia, Sept.
16, 1557, served for thirty-six years as Lutheran pastor in his native city. He was a noted
preacher and a gifted poet.
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
His hymn on the Trinity is one of the finest ever written on this
theme. It concludes with a splendid paraphrase of the Aaronic benediction. Two of its stanzas
are:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O holy, blessed Trinity,</p>
<p class="t0">Divine, eternal Unity,</p>
<p class="t0">God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="t0">Be Thou this day my guide and host.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, bless and keep Thou me as Thine;</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, make Thy face upon me shine;</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, lift Thy countenance on me,</p>
<p class="t0">And give me peace, sweet peace from Thee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Valerius Herberger was another heroic representative of this period of doctrinal strife, war,
famine, and pestilence. While pastor of St. Mary&rsquo;s Lutheran Church at Fraustadt, Posen, he and
his flock were expelled from their church in 1604 by King Sigismund III, of Poland, and the
property turned over to the Roman Catholics. Nothing daunted, however, Herberger and his
people immediately constructed a chapel out of two houses near the gates of the city. They
gave the structure the name of &ldquo;Kripplein Christi,&rdquo; since the first service was held in it on
Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>During the great pestilence which raged in 1613, the victims in Fraustadt numbered 2,135.
Herberger, however, stuck to his post, comforting the sick and burying the dead. It was during
these days that he wrote his famous hymn, &ldquo;Valet will ich dir geben,&rdquo; one of the finest hymns
for the dying in the German language. The hymn was published with the title, &ldquo;The farewell
(Valet) of Valerius Herberger that he gave to the world in the autumn of the year 1613, when
he every hour saw death before his eyes, but mercifully and
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
also as wonderfully as the three
men in the furnace at Babylon was nevertheless spared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The famous chorale tune for the hymn was written in 1613 by Melchior Teschner, who was
Herberger&rsquo;s precentor.</p>
<p>Other Lutheran hymn-writers of this period were Joachim Magdeburg, Martin Rutilius, Martin
Schalling and Philipp Nicolai. The last name in this group is by far the most important and will
be given more extensive notice in the following chapter. To Magdeburg, a pastor who saw
service in various parts of Germany and Hungary during a stormy career, we owe a single
hymn, &ldquo;Who trusts in God a strong abode.&rdquo; Rutilius has been credited with the authorship of
the gripping penitential hymn, &ldquo;Alas, my God! my sins are great,&rdquo; although the claim is
sometimes disputed. He was a pastor at Weimar, where he died in 1618.</p>
<p>Schalling likewise has bequeathed but a single hymn to the Church, but it may be regarded as
one of the classic hymns of Germany. Its opening line, &ldquo;O Lord, devoutly love I Thee,&rdquo; reflects
the ardent love of the author himself for the Saviour. It was entitled, &ldquo;A prayer to Christ, the
Consolation of the soul in life and death,&rdquo; and surely its message of confiding trust in God has
been a source of comfort and assurance to thousands of pious souls in the many vicissitudes of
life as well as in the valley of the shadow.</p>
<p>Although Schalling was a warm friend of Selnecker, he hesitated to subscribe to the Formula of
Concord, claiming that it dealt too harshly with the followers of Melanchthon. For this reason
he was deposed as General Superintendent of Oberpfalz and court preacher at Heidelberg.
Five years later, however, he was appointed pastor of St. Mary&rsquo;s church in N&uuml;rnberg, where he
remained until blindness compelled him to retire. He died in 1608.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h3>THE KING AND QUEEN OF CHORALES</h3>
<p>At rare intervals in the history of Christian hymnody, we meet with a genius who not only
possesses the gift of writing sublime poetry but also reveals talent as a composer of music.
During the stirring days of the Reformation such geniuses were revealed in the persons of
Martin Luther and Nicolaus Decius. We now encounter another, Philipp Nicolai, the writer of
the glorious hymn, &ldquo;Wachet auf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicolai&rsquo;s name would have been gratefully remembered by posterity had he merely written the
words of this hymn; but, when we learn that he also composed the magnificent chorale to
which it is sung, we are led to marvel. It has been called the &ldquo;King of Chorales,&rdquo; and well does
it deserve the title.</p>
<p>But Nicolai was also the composer of the &ldquo;Queen of Chorales.&rdquo; That is the name often given to
the tune of his other famous hymn, &ldquo;Wie sch&ouml;n leuchtet der Morgenstern.&rdquo;
Both of Nicolai&rsquo;s great tunes have been frequently appropriated for other hymns. The &ldquo;King of
Chorales&rdquo; has lent inspiration to &ldquo;Holy Majesty, before Thee,&rdquo; while the &ldquo;Queen of Chorales&rdquo;
has helped to glorify such hymns as &ldquo;All hail to thee, O blessed morn,&rdquo; &ldquo;Now Israel&rsquo;s hope in
triumph ends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Holy Spirit, enter in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the world&rsquo;s greatest composers have recognized the beauty and majesty of Nicolai&rsquo;s
inspiring themes and
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
have seized upon his chorales to weave them into a number of famous
musical masterpieces. The strains of the seventh and eighth lines of &ldquo;Wachet auf&rdquo; may be heard
in the passage, &ldquo;The kingdoms of this world,&rdquo; of Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hallelujah chorus.&rdquo; Mendelssohn
introduces the air in his overture to &ldquo;St. Paul,&rdquo; and the entire chorale occurs in his &ldquo;Hymn of
Praise.&rdquo; The latter composer has also made use of the &ldquo;Wie sch&ouml;n&rdquo; theme in the first chorus of
his unpublished oratorio, &ldquo;Christus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The circumstances that called forth Nicolai&rsquo;s two great hymns and the classic chorales to which
he wedded them are tragic in nature. A dreadful pestilence was raging in Westphalia. At Unna,
where Nicolai was pastor, 1,300 villagers died of the plague between July, 1597, and January,
1598. During a single week in the month of August no less than 170 victims were claimed by
the messenger of death.</p>
<p>From the parsonage which overlooked the churchyard, Nicolai was a sad witness of the
burials. On one day thirty graves were dug. In the midst of these days of distress the gifted
Lutheran pastor wrote a series of meditations to which he gave the title, &ldquo;Freuden Spiegel,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Mirror of Joy.&rdquo; His purpose, as he explains in his preface, dated August 10, 1598, was &ldquo;to leave
it behind me (if God should call me from this world) as the token of my peaceful, joyful,
Christian departure, or (if God should spare me in health) to comfort other sufferers whom He
should also visit with the pestilence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seemed to me,&rdquo; he writes in the same preface, &ldquo;nothing more sweet, delightful and
agreeable, than the contemplation of the noble, sublime doctrine of Eternal Life obtained
through the Blood of Christ. This I allowed to dwell in my heart day and night, and searched
the Scriptures
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
as to what they revealed on this matter, read also the sweet treatise of the
ancient doctor Saint Augustine (&ldquo;The City of God&rdquo;) ... Then day by day I wrote out my meditations,
found myself, thank God! wonderfully well, comforted in heart, joyful in spirit, and truly
content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of Nicolai&rsquo;s classic hymns appeared for the first time in his &ldquo;Mirror of Joy.&rdquo; As a title to
&ldquo;Wachet auf&rdquo; Nicolai wrote, &ldquo;Of the voice at Midnight, and the Wise Virgins who meet their
Heavenly Bridegroom. Mt. 25.&rdquo; The title to &ldquo;Wie sch&ouml;n&rdquo; reads, &ldquo;A spiritual bridal song of the
believing soul concerning Jesus Christ, her Heavenly Bridegroom, founded on the 45th Psalm
of the prophet David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that the melody to &ldquo;Wie sch&ouml;n&rdquo; became so popular that numerous church chimes were
set to it.</p>
<p>Nicolai&rsquo;s life was filled with stirring events. He was born at Mengerinhausen, August 10, 1556.
His father was a Lutheran pastor. After completing studies at the Universities of Erf&uuml;rt and
Wittenberg, he too was ordained to the ministry in 1583. His first charge was at Herdecke, but
since the town council was composed of Roman Catholic members, he soon was compelled to
leave that place. Later he served at Niederwildungen and Altwildungen, and in 1596 he
became pastor at Unna. After the dreadful pestilence of 1597 there came an invasion of
Spaniards in 1598, and Nicolai was forced to flee.</p>
<p>In 1601 he was chosen chief pastor of St. Katherine&rsquo;s church in Hamburg. Here he gained fame
as a preacher, being hailed as a &ldquo;second Chrysostom.&rdquo; Throughout a long and bitter
controversy with the Calvinists regarding the nature of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, Nicolai was looked
upon as the &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of the Lutheran Church, and the guardian of its doctrines. He died October
26, 1608.</p>

<div id="c10" title="Hymns of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War">
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<h3>HYMNS OF THE THIRTY YEARS&rsquo; WAR</h3>
<p>Times of suffering and affliction have often brought forth great poets. This was especially true
of that troublous period in European history known as the &ldquo;Thirty Years&rsquo; War.&rdquo; Although it was
one of the most distressing eras in the Protestant Church, it gave birth to some of its grandest
hymns.</p>
<p>It was during this dreadful period, when Germany was devastated and depopulated by all the
miseries of a bloody warfare, that Johann Heermann lived and wrought. He was born at
Rauden, Silesia, October 11, 1585, the son of a poverty-stricken furrier. There were five children
in the family, but four of them were snatched away by death within a short time. Johann, who
was the youngest, was also taken ill, and the despairing mother was torn by fear and anguish.
Turning to God in her hour of need, she vowed that if He would spare her babe, she would
educate him for the ministry.</p>
<p>She did not forget her promise. The child whose life was spared grew to manhood, received his
training at several institutions, and in 1611 entered the holy ministry as pastor of the Lutheran
church at Koeben, not far from his birthplace.</p>
<p>A few years later the Thirty Years&rsquo; War broke out, and all of Germany began to feel its horrors.
Four times during the period from 1629 to 1634 the town of Koeben was sacked by the armies
of Wallenstein, who had been sent by the king of Austria to restore the German principalities
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to the Catholic faith. Previous to this, in 1616, the city was almost destroyed by fire. In 1631 it
was visited by the dreadful pestilence.</p>
<p>Again and again Heermann was forced to flee from the city, and several times he lost all his
earthly possessions. Once, when he was crossing the Oder, he was pursued and nearly
captured by enemy soldiers, who shot after him. Twice he was nearly sabred.</p>
<p>It was during this period, in 1630, that his beautiful hymn, &ldquo;Herzliebster Jesu,&rdquo; was first
published. One of the stanzas which is not usually given in translations reflects very clearly the
unfaltering faith of the noble pastor during these hard experiences. It reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whate&rsquo;er of earthly good this life may grant me</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll risk for Thee; no shame, no cross shall daunt me;</p>
<p class="t0">I shall not fear what man can do to harm me,</p>
<p class="t">Nor death alarm me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hymn immediately sprang into popularity in Germany, perhaps through the fact that it
reflected the feelings of Protestants everywhere, and partly because of the gripping tune
written for it in 1640 by the great musician Johann Cr&uuml;ger.</p>
<p>Heermann has been ranked with Luther and Gerhardt as one of the greatest hymn-writers the
Lutheran Church has produced. Because his hymns were written during such times of distress
and suffering, they seemed to grip the hearts of the German people to an extraordinary degree.</p>
<p>One of his hymns, published in 1630 under the group known as &ldquo;Songs of Tears,&rdquo; is entitled
&ldquo;Treuer W&auml;chter Israel.&rdquo; It contains a striking line imploring God to &ldquo;build a wall around us.&rdquo; A
very interesting story is told concerning this hymn. On January 5, 1814, the Allied forces
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
were about to enter Schleswig. A poor widow and her daughter and grandson lived in a little house
near the entrance of the town. The grandson was reading Heermann&rsquo;s hymns written for times
of war, and when he came to this one, he exclaimed, &ldquo;It would be a good thing, grandmother, if
our Lord would build a wall around us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day all through the town cries of terror were heard, but not a soldier molested the
widow&rsquo;s home. When on the following morning they summoned enough courage to open their
door, lo, a snowdrift had concealed them from the view of the enemy! On this incident
Clemens Brentano wrote a beautiful poem, &ldquo;Draus vor Schleswig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another remarkable story is recorded concerning Heermann&rsquo;s great hymn, &ldquo;O Jesus, Saviour
dear.&rdquo; At Leuthen, in Silesia, December 5, 1757, the Prussians under Frederick the Great were
facing an army of Austrians three times their number. Just before the battle began some of the
Prussians began to sing the second stanza of the hymn. The regimental bands took up the
music. One of the commanders asked Frederick if it should be silenced. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;let
it be. With such men God will today certainly give me the victory.&rdquo; When the bloody battle
ended with victory for the Prussians, Frederick exclaimed &ldquo;My God, what a power has
religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other famous hymns by Heermann include &ldquo;O Christ, our true and only Light,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, Thy
death and passion give&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faithful God, I lay before Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many other noted hymn-writers belong to the period of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, among them
Martin Opitz, George Weissel, Heinrich Held, Ernst Homburg, Johannes Olearius, Josua
Stegmann, and Wilhelm II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Opitz was somewhat of a diplomat and courtier, as well as a poet. He was a man of vacillating
character, and did not hesitate to lend his support to the Romanists whenever it served his
personal interests. However, he has left to posterity an imperishable hymn in &ldquo;Light of Light, O
Sun of heaven.&rdquo; He is credited with having reformed the art of verse-writing in Germany. He
died of the pestilence in Danzig in 1639.</p>
<p>Homburg and Held were lawyers. Homburg was born near Eisenach in 1605, and later we find
him practising law in Naumburg, Saxony. He was a man of great poetic talent, but at first he
devoted his gifts to writing love ballads and drinking songs. During the days of the dread
pestilence he turned to God, and now he began to write hymns. In 1659 he published a collection of
150 spiritual songs. In a preface he speaks of them as his &ldquo;Sunday labor,&rdquo; and he tells how he
had been led to write them &ldquo;by the anxious and sore domestic afflictions by which God ... has
for some time laid me aside.&rdquo; The Lenten hymn, &ldquo;Christ, the Life of all the living,&rdquo; is found in
this collection.</p>
<p>Held, who practiced law in his native town of Guhrau, Silesia, also was a man chastened in the
school of sorrow and affliction. He is the author of two hymns that have found their way into
the English language&mdash;&ldquo;Let the earth now praise the Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;Come, O come, Thou
quickening Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weissel, a Lutheran pastor at Konigsberg, has given us one of the finest Advent hymns in the
German language, &ldquo;Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olearius, who wrote a commentary on the Bible and compiled one of the most important
hymn-books of the 17th
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
century, has also bequeathed to the Church a splendid Advent hymn,
&ldquo;Comfort, comfort ye My people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stegmann, a theological professor at Rinteln who suffered much persecution at the hands of
Benedictine monks during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, was the author of the beautiful evening
hymn, &ldquo;Abide with us, our Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilhelm II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, who wrote the inspiring hymn, &ldquo;O Christ, Thy grace unto us
lend,&rdquo; was not only a poet and musician, but also a man of war. He was twice wounded in
battle with the Imperial forces, and was once left for dead. He was taken prisoner by Tilly, but
was released by the emperor. When Gustavus Adolphus came to Germany to save the
Protestant cause, Wilhelm after some hesitation joined him. However, when the Duke in 1635
made a separate peace with the emperor, the Swedish army ravaged his territory.</p>
<p>Johann Meyfart also belongs to this period. He was a theological professor at the University of
Erf&uuml;rt, and died at that place in 1642. One of his hymns, &ldquo;Jerusalem, thou city fair and high,&rdquo;
has found its way into English hymn books.</p>
<p>The beautiful hymn, &ldquo;O how blest are ye,&rdquo; which was translated into English by Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow, comes to us from the pen of Simon Dach, another Lutheran theologian
who lived during these stirring days. Dach, who was professor of poetry and dean of the
philosophical faculty of the University of K&ouml;nigsberg, wrote some 165 hymns. They are marked
by fulness of faith and a quiet confidence in God in the midst of a world of turmoil and
uncertainty. Dach died in 1659 after a lingering illness. The first stanza of his funeral hymn
reads</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O how blest are ye, whose toils are ended!</p>
<p class="t0">Who through death have unto God ascended!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye have arisen</p>
<p class="t0">From the cares which keep us still in prison.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Tobias Clausnitzer, who has bequeathed to the Church the hymn, &ldquo;Blessed Jesus, at Thy Word,&rdquo;
was the chaplain of a Swedish regiment during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. He preached the
thanksgiving sermon at the field service held by command of General Wrangel at Weiden, in
the Upper Palatine, on January 1, 1649, after the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia. He
afterwards became pastor at Weiden, where he remained until his death in 1684.</p>
<p>Johann Quirsfeld, archdeacon in Pirna, has given us a very impressive Good Friday hymn,
&ldquo;Sinful world, behold the anguish.&rdquo; Quirsfeld died in 1686.</p>
<p>Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, a noted Orientalist, scientist and statesman of the seventeenth
century, in addition to duties of state edited several Rabbinical writings and works on Oriental
mysticism. He also wrote hymns, among them &ldquo;Dayspring of eternity,&rdquo; which has been referred
to by one writer as &ldquo;one of the freshest, most original, and spirited of morning hymns, as if
born from the dew of the sunrise.&rdquo; He died at Sulzbach, Bavaria, May 8, 1689, at the very hour,
it is said, which he himself had predicted.</p>
<p>The extent to which Lutheran laymen of this period devoted themselves to spiritual exercises is
revealed in the life of Johann Franck, a lawyer who became mayor of his native town of Guben,
Brandenburg, in 1661. To him we are indebted for the finest communion hymn in the German
language, &ldquo;Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness.&rdquo; He also was the author of such gems as
&ldquo;Light of the Gentile nations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, to Thee I make confession,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord God, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
worship Thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus, priceless Treasure,&rdquo; and the glorious song of praise:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise the Lord, each tribe and nation,</p>
<p class="t">Praise Him with a joyful heart;</p>
<p class="t0">Ye who know His full salvation,</p>
<p class="t">Gather now from every part;</p>
<p class="t0">Let your voices glorify</p>
<p class="t0">In His temple God on high.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was Franck who began the long series of so-called &ldquo;Jesus hymns,&rdquo; which reached their fullest
development in the later Pietistic school of hymnists. Franck held that poetry should be &ldquo;the
nurse of piety, the herald of immortality, the promoter of cheerfulness, the conqueror of sadness,
and a foretaste of heavenly glory.&rdquo; His hymns reflect his beautiful spirit of Christian
cheerfulness and hope.</p>
<p>The last name that we would mention is Heinrich Theobald Schenk, a pastor at Giessen. Not
much is known of this man except that he was the writer of a single hymn, but it is a hymn that
has gained for him the thanks of posterity. There is scarcely a hymn-book of any communion
today that does not contain, &ldquo;Who are these, like stars appearing?&rdquo; Schenk died in 1727, at the
age of 71 years.</p>

<h3>A Hymn Made Famous on a Battle Field</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Be not dismayed, thou little flock&rdquo; will always be known as the &ldquo;swan-song&rdquo; of the Swedish
hero king, Gustavus Adolphus.</p>
<p>No incident in modern history is more dramatic than the sudden appearance in Germany of
Gustavus Adolphus and his little Swedish army during the critical days of the Thirty Years&rsquo;
War. It was this victorious crusade that saved Germany, and probably all of northern Europe,
for Protestantism.</p>
<p>The untimely death of the Swedish monarch on the battlefield of L&uuml;tzen, November 6, 1632,
while leading his men against Wallenstein&rsquo;s host, not only gained immortal fame for Gustavus,
but will always cause the world to remember the hymn that was sung by his army on that
historic day.</p>
<p>When Gustavus Adolphus landed in Germany in 1630 with his small but well-trained army, it
seemed that the Protestant cause in Europe was lost. All the Protestant princes of Germany had
been defeated by Tilly and Wallenstein, leaders of the Imperial armies, and the victors were
preparing to crush every vestige of Lutheranism in Germany.</p>
<p>The Margrave of Brandenburg and the Duke of Saxony, however, furnished a few troops to
Gustavus, and in a swift, meteoric campaign the Swedish king had routed the army of the
Catholic League and had marched all the way across
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
Germany. In the spring of 1632 Gustavus
moved into the heart of Bavaria and captured Munich.</p>
<p>The Imperial forces who had sneered at the &ldquo;Snow King,&rdquo; as they called him, and who had
predicted that he would &ldquo;melt&rdquo; as he came southward, were now filled with dismay. The
&ldquo;Snow King&rdquo; proved to be the &ldquo;Lion of the North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wallenstein rallied the Catholic forces for a last stand at L&uuml;tzen, the
battle that was to prove the decisive conflict.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 6, 1632, the two armies faced each other in battle array. Dr.
Fabricius, chaplain of the Swedish army, had been commanded by Gustavus to lead his troops
in worship. The king himself raised the strains of &ldquo;Be not dismayed, thou little flock,&rdquo; and led
the army in singing the stirring hymn. Then he knelt in fervent prayer.</p>
<p>A heavy fog prevented the Protestant forces from moving forward to the attack, and, while
they were waiting for the fog to lift, Gustavus ordered the musicians to play Luther&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;A
mighty Fortress is our God.&rdquo; The whole army joined with a shout. The king then mounted his
charger, and, drawing his sword, rode back and forth in front of the lines, speaking words of
encouragement to his men.</p>
<p>As the sun began to break through the fog, Gustavus himself offered a prayer, &ldquo;Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus, help me today to do battle for the glory of Thy holy name,&rdquo; and then shouted, &ldquo;Now
forward to the attack in the name of our God!&rdquo; The army answered, &ldquo;God with us!&rdquo; and rushed
forward, the king galloping in the lead.</p>
<p>When his aid offered him his coat of mail, Gustavus refused to put it on, declaring, &ldquo;God is my
Protector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle raged fiercely. For a time the outcome seemed ominous for the Lutherans. At 11
o&rsquo;clock Gustavus was
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
struck by a bullet and mortally wounded. As he fell from his horse, the
word spread quickly throughout the Swedish lines, &ldquo;The king is wounded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It proved to be the turning point in the battle. Instead of losing heart and fleeing, the Swedish
troops charged the foe with a fierceness born of sorrow and despair, and before the day was
ended another glorious victory had been won. The Protestant cause was saved, but the noble
Gustavus had made the supreme sacrifice.</p>
<p>The authorship of his famous &ldquo;battle-hymn&rdquo; has been the subject of much dispute. The German
poet and hymnologist, Albert Knapp, has called it &ldquo;a little feather from the eagle wing of
Gustavus Adolphus.&rdquo; Most Swedish authorities, too, unite in naming their hero king as the
author. However, the weight of evidence seems to point to Johann Michael Altenberg, a
German pastor of Gross Sommern, Th&uuml;ringen, as the real writer of the hymn. It is said that
Altenberg was inspired to write it upon hearing of the great victory gained by Gustavus
Adolphus at the battle of Leipzig, September 7, 1631, about a year before the battle of L&uuml;tzen.</p>
<p>In any event, it is a matter of record that the Swedish king adopted it immediately, and that he
sang it as his own &ldquo;swan-song&rdquo; just before he died at L&uuml;tzen. Someone has aptly said, &ldquo;Whether
German or Swede may claim this hymn is a question. They both rightly own it.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c12" title="The Lutheran Te Deum">
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<h3>THE LUTHERAN TE DEUM</h3>
<p>The last of the great Lutheran hymn-writers belonging to the period of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War
was Martin Rinkart. Except for the time of the Reformation, this period was probably the
greatest creative epoch in the history of Lutheran hymnody. But of all the glorious hymns that
were written during those stirring years, there is none that equals Rinkart&rsquo;s famous hymn,
&ldquo;Now thank we all our God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The date of this remarkable hymn is obscure. The claim has been made that it was written as a
hymn of thanksgiving following the Peace of Westphalia, which in 1648 brought to an end the
long and cruel war. This claim has been based on the fact that the first two stanzas are a
paraphrase of the words of the high priest Simeon, recorded in the Apocryphal book
Ecclesiasticus 50:29-32: &ldquo;And now let all praise God, who hath done great things, who hath
glorified our days, and dealeth with us according to His loving-kindness. He giveth us the joy
of our hearts, that we may find peace in Israel as in the days of yore, thus He lets His
loving-kindness remain with us, and He will redeem us in our day.&rdquo; Inasmuch as this was the
Scripture passage on which all regimental chaplains were ordered to preach in celebration of
the conclusion of peace, it has been inferred that Rinkart was inspired to write his hymn at that
time.</p>
<p>It is probable, however, that these circumstances were merely a coincidence, and that the hymn
was written several years previous to 1648. In Rinkart&rsquo;s own volume,
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
&ldquo;Jesu Hertz-Buchlein,&rdquo; it
appears under the title &ldquo;Tisch-Gebetlein,&rdquo; or a short prayer before meals, and many believe
that it was originally written for Rinkart&rsquo;s children. It will be noticed that, while the first two
stanzas are based on the passage from Ecclesiasticus, the last stanza is the ancient doxology,
<i>Gloria Patri</i>.</p>
<p>No hymn except Luther&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;A mighty Fortress is our God&rdquo; has been used more generally
in the Lutheran Church than Rinkart&rsquo;s glorious paean of praise. In Germany, where it has
become the national <i>Te Deum</i>, it is sung at all impressive occasions. After the battle of Leuthen,
the army of Frederick the Great raised the strains of this noble hymn, and it is said that even
the mortally wounded joined in the singing.</p>
<p>In his history of the Franco-Prussian War, Cassel tells of a stirring incident that took place on
the day following the battle of Sedan, where the Germans had won a decisive victory over the
French. A multitude of Prussian troops who were marching toward Paris were billeted in the
parish church of Augecourt. They could not sleep because of the extreme excitement of the day.
Suddenly a strain of music came from the organ, first very softly but gradually swelling in
volume until the whole sanctuary shook. It was the grand old hymn&mdash;&ldquo;Nun danket alle Gott!&rdquo;
Instantly men and officers were upon their feet, singing the stirring words. Then followed
Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ein feste Burg,&rdquo; after which the terrible strain seemed relieved, and they laid
themselves down to peaceful slumber.</p>
<p>It is recorded that the hymn was also sung at the opening of the magnificent Cathedral of
Cologne, August 14, 1880, as well as at the laying of the cornerstone of the Parliament building
in Berlin, June 9, 1884. It has also achieved great
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
popularity in England, where it was sung as a
<i>Te Deum</i> in nearly all churches and chapels at the close of the Boer War in 1902.</p>
<p>Rinkart&rsquo;s life was a tragic one. The greater part of his public service was rendered during the
horrors of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. He was born at Eilenburg, Saxony, April 23, 1586. After
attending a Latin school in his home town, he became a student at the University of Leipzig.</p>
<p>In 1617, by invitation of the town council of Eilenburg, he became pastor of the church in the
city of his birth. It was at the beginning of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and, because Eilenburg was a
walled city, it became a refuge for thousands who had lost everything in the conflict. Famine
and pestilence added to the horror of the situation, and the other two pastors of the city having
died, Rinkart was left alone to minister to the spiritual needs of the populace.</p>
<p>Twice Eilenburg was saved from the Swedish army through the intercession of Rinkart, first in
1637 and again in 1639. A levy of 30,000 thaler had been made on the city by the Swedish
general to aid the Protestant cause. Knowing the impoverished condition of his townsmen,
Rinkart went out to the Swedish camp to plead their cause, but to no avail. Turning to those
who were with him, Rinkart exclaimed, &ldquo;Come, my children, we can find no mercy with men,
let us take refuge with God.&rdquo; He then fell on his knees and uttered a fervent prayer, after which
they sang the hymn of Paul Eber so much used in those trying days, &ldquo;When in the hour of
utmost need.&rdquo; The scene made such an impression on the Swedish commander that he relented
and reduced his demand to 2,000 florins or 1,350 thaler.</p>
<p>Rinkart lived only a year after the close of the bloody war. He died, a worn and broken man, in
1649.</p>

</div>
<div id="c13" title="Paul Gerhardt, Prince of Lutheran Hymnists">
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h3>PAUL GERHARDT, PRINCE OF LUTHERAN HYMNISTS</h3>
<p>The greatest Lutheran hymnist of the seventeenth century, and perhaps of all time, was Paul
Gerhardt.</p>
<p>Not even the hymns of Martin Luther are used so generally throughout the Christian world as
those of Gerhardt. More of the beautiful lyrics of this sweet singer have found their way into
the English language than the hymns of any other German writer, and with the passing of
years their popularity increases rather than diminishes.</p>
<p>In the Lutheran church at L&uuml;bden, in Germany, there hangs a life-size painting of Gerhardt.
Beneath it is this inscription: <i>Theologus in cribro Satanae versatus</i>, &ldquo;A divine sifted in Satan&rsquo;s
sieve.&rdquo; That inscription may be said to epitomize the sad life-story of Germany&rsquo;s great psalmist.</p>
<p>Gerhardt was born March 12, 1607, in Gr&auml;fenhaynichen, a village near the celebrated
Wittenberg. His father, who was mayor of the village, died before Paul reached maturity.
When he was twenty-one years of age he began the study of theology at the University of
Wittenberg. The Thirty Years&rsquo; War was raging, and all Germany was desolate and suffering.
Because of the difficulty of securing a parish, Gerhardt served for several years as a tutor in the
home of Andreas Barthold, whose daughter Anna Maria became his bride in 1655.</p>
<p>It was during this period that Gerhardt&rsquo;s poetic gifts began to flourish. No doubt he was greatly
stimulated by contact with the famous musician Johann Cr&uuml;ger, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
was cantor and director
of music in the Church of St. Nicholas in Berlin. In 1648 many of Gerhardt&rsquo;s hymns were
published in Cr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s <i>Praxis Pietatis Melica</i>.</p>
<p>Through the recommendation of the Berlin clergy, he was appointed Lutheran provost at
Mittenwalde, and was ordained to this post November 18, 1651. Six years later he accepted the
position of third assistant pastor of the Church of St. Nicholas in Berlin. His hymns continued
to grow in popularity, and his fame as a preacher drew large audiences to hear him.</p>
<p>The controversy between the Lutherans and Calvinists, which had continued from the days of
the Reformation, flared up again at this time as the result of efforts on the part of Elector
Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia to unite the two parties. Friedrich Wilhelm, who was a Calvinist,
sought to compel the clergy to sign a document promising that they would abstain from any
references in their sermons to doctrinal differences. Gerhardt was sick at the time, and,
although he had always been moderate in his utterances, he felt that to sign such a document
would be to compromise the faith. Summoning the other Lutheran clergymen of Berlin to his
bedside, he urged them to stand firm and to refuse to surrender to the demands of the Elector.</p>
<p>Soon after this the courageous pastor was deposed from office. He was also prohibited from
holding private services in his own home. Though he felt the blow very keenly, he met it with
true Christian fortitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is only a small Berlin affliction; but I am also willing and ready to seal with my
blood the evangelical truth, and, like my namesake, St. Paul, to offer my neck to the sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To add to his sorrows, Gerhardt&rsquo;s wife and a son died in
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the midst of these troubles. Three
other children had died previous to this, and now the sorely tried pastor was left with a single
child, a boy of six years. In May, 1669, he was called to the church at L&uuml;bden, where he labored
faithfully and with great success until his death, on June 7, 1676.</p>
<p>The glorious spirit that dwelt in him, and which neither trials nor persecutions could quench, is
reflected in the lines of his famous hymn, &ldquo;If God Himself be for me,&rdquo; based on the latter part of
the eighth chapter of Romans:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Though earth be rent asunder,</p>
<p class="t">Thou&rsquo;rt mine eternally;</p>
<p class="t0">Not fire, nor sword, nor thunder,</p>
<p class="t">Shall sever me from Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Not hunger, thirst, nor danger,</p>
<p class="t">Not pain nor poverty,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor mighty princes&rsquo; anger,</p>
<p class="t">Shall ever hinder me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Catherine Winkworth, who has translated the same hymn in a different meter under the title,
&ldquo;Since Jesus is my Friend,&rdquo; has probably succeeded best in giving expression to the triumphant
faith and the note of transcendent hope and joy in the final stanza:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My heart for gladness springs;</p>
<p class="t">It cannot more be sad;</p>
<p class="t0">For very joy it smiles and sings&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Sees naught but sunshine glad.</p>
<p class="t0">The Sun that lights mine eyes</p>
<p class="t">Is Christ, the Lord I love;</p>
<p class="t0">I sing for joy of that which lies</p>
<p class="t">Stored up for me above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because of his own warm, confiding, childlike faith in God, Gerhardt&rsquo;s hymns have become a
source of special comfort to sorrowing and heavy-laden souls. They not only
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
breathe a spirit of
tender consolation but of a &ldquo;joy unspeakable and full of glory.&rdquo; We have a beautiful example of
this in his Advent hymn, &ldquo;O how shall I receive Thee&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rejoice then, ye sad-hearted,</p>
<p class="t">Who sit in deepest gloom,</p>
<p class="t0">Who mourn o&rsquo;er joys departed,</p>
<p class="t">And tremble at your doom;</p>
<p class="t0">He who alone can cheer you</p>
<p class="t">Is standing at the door;</p>
<p class="t0">He brings His pity near you,</p>
<p class="t">And bids you weep no more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Gerhardt&rsquo;s hymns we find a transition to the modern subjective note in hymnody. Sixteen of
his hymns begin with the pronoun, &ldquo;I.&rdquo; They are not characterized, however, by the weak
sentimentality so often found in the hymns of our own day, for Gerhardt never lost sight of the
greatest objective truth revealed to men&mdash;justification by faith alone. Nevertheless, because of
his constant emphasis on the love of God and because his hymns are truly &ldquo;songs of the heart,&rdquo;
they possess a degree of emotional warmth that is lacking in the earlier Lutheran hymns.</p>
<p>His hymns on the glories of nature have never been surpassed. In contemplating the beauty of
created things he is ever praising the Creator. His famous evening hymn, &ldquo;Nun ruhen alle
W&auml;lder,&rdquo; has been likened to the beauty and splendor of the evening star. In a marvelous
manner the temporal and the eternal, the terrestrial and the celestial are contrasted in every
stanza. It was a favorite hymn of the great German poet, Friedrich von Schiller, who first heard
it sung by his mother as a cradle song. Probably no hymn is so generally used by the children
of Germany as an evening prayer as this one. The most familiar English
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
translation begins with
the line, &ldquo;Now rest beneath night&rsquo;s shadow.&rdquo; A more recent translation of rare beauty runs:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The restless day now closeth,</p>
<p class="t0">Each flower and tree reposeth,</p>
<p class="t">Shade creeps o&rsquo;er wild and wood:</p>
<p class="t0">Let us, as night is falling,</p>
<p class="t0">On God our Maker calling,</p>
<p class="t">Give thanks to Him, the Giver good.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The tune to which this hymn is sung is as famous as the hymn itself. It is ascribed to Heinrich
Isaak, one of the first of the great German church musicians. It is believed to have been
composed by him in 1490, when he was leaving his native town, Innsbruck, to establish himself
at the court of Emperor Maximilian I. It was set to the plaintive words, &ldquo;Innsbruck, ich muss
dich lassen.&rdquo; According to tradition, Isaak first heard the beautiful melody sung by a
wandering minstrel. Bach and Mozart regarded it as one of the sublimest of all chorales, and
each is said to have declared that he would rather have been the composer of this tune than
any of his great masterpieces.</p>
<p>Gerhardt wrote 123 hymns in all. In addition to the hymns already mentioned, probably his
most famous is &ldquo;O sacred Head, now wounded,&rdquo; based on the Latin hymn of Bernard of
Clairvaux. Other hymns in common use are &ldquo;Immanuel, we sing Thy praise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Holy Ghost,
dispel our sadness,&rdquo; &ldquo;O enter, Lord, Thy temple,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shun, my heart, the thought forever,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Commit thou all thy griefs,&rdquo; &ldquo;All my heart this night rejoices,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beside Thy manger here I
stand,&rdquo; &ldquo;Awake, my heart, and marvel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Go forth, my heart, and seek delight,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Saviour
dear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A pilgrim and a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the briefest mention can be made of other German
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Lutheran hymn-writers of this period.
One of these, Johan Rist, pastor in Wedel, was crowned poet laureate of Germany by Emperor
Ferdinand III in 1644, and nine years later was raised to the nobility. Rist wrote some 680
hymns, but all are not of uniform excellence. Among those in common use to-day are &ldquo;Arise,
the kingdom is at hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;Help us, O Lord, behold we enter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rise, O Salem, rise and shine,&rdquo;
&ldquo;O Living Bread from heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Jesus Christ, Thou Bread of Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Father, merciful and
holy,&rdquo; which has also been translated &ldquo;Soul of mine, to God awaking,&rdquo; &ldquo;O darkest woe,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Arise, arise ye Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georg Neumark, court poet and secretary of archives under Duke Wilhelm II of Saxe-Weimar,
has left us the hymn of trust in God: &ldquo;Let, O my soul, thy God direct thee,&rdquo; which is also known
by the English translation, &ldquo;If thou but suffer God to guide thee.&rdquo; The hymn was written in
1641, at Kiel, when, after being robbed of practically all he possessed except his prayer-book,
Neumark succeeded in obtaining employment as tutor in a wealthy family. He was a destitute
student at the time.</p>
<p>Michael Schirmer, an educator and poet who lived in Berlin during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War and
for two decades after its close, is the author of a number of beautiful hymns, among them the
Pentecost hymn, &ldquo;O Holy Spirit, enter in.&rdquo; Because of poverty and afflictions suffered during a
period of war and pestilence, he has been called &ldquo;the German Job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahasuerus Fritsch, chancellor and president of the Consistory of Rudolstadt, is credited with
the authorship of &ldquo;Jesus is my Joy, my All,&rdquo; a hymn that reflects the spirit of true evangelical
piety. He died in 1701.</p>
<p>Caspar Neumann, another of Gerhardt&rsquo;s contemporaries, has bequeathed to the Church the
sublime hymn, &ldquo;God of
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Ages, all transcending,&rdquo; the last stanza of which is unusually striking in
language:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Say Amen, O God our Father,</p>
<p class="t">To the praise we offer Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Now, to laud Thy name we gather;</p>
<p class="t">Let this to Thy glory be.</p>
<p class="t0">Fill us with Thy love and grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Till we see Thee face to face.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Neumann, who was a celebrated preacher and professor of theology at Breslau from 1678 to
1715, was the author of some thirty hymns, all of which became very popular in Silesia. He was
also author of a famous devotional book, &ldquo;Kern aller Gebete.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>JOACHIM NEANDER, THE PAUL GERHARDT OF THE CALVINISTS</h3>
<p>While all Germany during the latter half of the seventeenth
century was singing the sublime lyrics of
Paul Gerhardt, prince of Lutheran hymnists, the
spirit of hymnody was beginning to stir in the soul of another
German poet&mdash;Joachim Neander. This man, whose name
will always be remembered as the author of one of the most
glorious hymns of praise of the Christian Church, was the
first hymn-writer produced by the Reformed, or Calvinistic,
branch of the Protestant Church.</p>
<p>Hymnody in the Reformed Church had been seriously
retarded by the iconoclastic views of Calvin and Zwingli.
These Reformers at first frowned on church choirs, organs,
and every form of ecclesiastical art. Even hymns, such as
those used by the Lutherans, were prohibited because they
were the production of men. God could be worshiped in a
worthy manner, according to Calvin&rsquo;s principles, only by
hymns which were divinely inspired, namely, the Psalms of
the Old Testament Psaltery.</p>
<p>This gave rise to the practice of versifying the Psalms.
Calvin&rsquo;s insistence that there should be the strictest adherence
to the original text often resulted in crude paraphrases.
The exclusive use of the Psalms explains the
development of so-called &ldquo;psalmody&rdquo; in the Reformed
Church as over against &ldquo;hymnody&rdquo; in the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>Psalmody had its inception in France, where Clement
Marot, court poet to King Francis I, rendered a number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the Psalms into metrical form. Marot was a gifted and
versatile genius, but not inclined to piety or serious-mindedness.
However, his versified Psalms became immensely popular
with the French Huguenots and exerted a great influence
in the struggle between the Protestants and the papal
party. When Marot was compelled to flee to Geneva because
of Roman persecution, he collaborated with Calvin
in publishing the famous Genevan Psalter, which appeared
in 1543.</p>
<p>Following the death of Marot in 1544, Calvin engaged
Theodore de Beza to continue the work, and in 1562 the
Genevan Psalter was published in completed form, containing
all the Psalms in versified dress. The musical editor
during the greater part of this period was Louis Bourgeois,
to whom is generally ascribed the undying honor of being
the composer of probably the most famous of all Christian
hymn tunes, &ldquo;Old Hundredth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Genevan Psalter was translated into many languages,
and became the accepted hymn-book of the Reformed Church
in Germany, England, Scotland, and Holland, as well as in
France. In Germany the most popular version was a translation
by Ambrosius Lobwasser, a professor of law at
K&ouml;nigsberg, who, oddly enough, was a Lutheran.</p>
<p>For more than 150 years Lutheran hymn-writers had been
pouring out a mighty stream of inspired song, but the voice
of hymnody was stifled in the Reformed Church. Then
came Joachim Neander. His life was short&mdash;he died at
the age of thirty&mdash;and many of his hymns seem to have
been written in the last few months before his death; but
the influence he exerted on the subsequent hymnody of his
Church earned for him the title, &ldquo;the Gerhardt of the Reformed
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Neander&rsquo;s hymns are preeminently hymns of praise. Their
jubilant tone and smooth rhythmical flow are at once an
invitation to sing them. They speedily found their way
into Lutheran hymn-books in Germany, and from thence to
the entire Protestant world. Neander&rsquo;s most famous hymn,
&ldquo;Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,&rdquo; with its splendid chorale
melody, grows in popularity with the passing of years, and
promises to live on as one of the greatest <i>Te Deums</i> of the
Christian Church.</p>
<p>Joachim Neander was born in Bremen, Germany, in 1650.
He came from a distinguished line of clergymen, his father,
grandfather, great grandfather and great great grandfather
having been pastors, and all of them bearing the name Joachim
Neander.</p>
<p>Young Joachim entered the Academic Gymnasium of
Bremen at the age of sixteen years. It seems that he led
a careless and profligate life, joining in the sins and follies
that characterized student life in his age.</p>
<p>In the year 1670, when Neander was twenty years old,
he chanced to attend services in St. Martin&rsquo;s church, Bremen,
where Theodore Under-Eyck had recently come as
pastor. Two other students accompanied Neander, their
main purpose being to criticize and scoff at the sermon.
However, they had not reckoned with the Spirit of God.
The burning words of Under-Eyck made a powerful impression
on the mind and heart of the youthful Neander,
and he who went to scoff came away to pray.</p>
<p>It proved the turning point in the spiritual life of the
young student. Under the guidance of Under-Eyck he was
led to embrace Christ as his Saviour, and from that time
he and Under-Eyck were life-long friends.</p>
<p>The following year Neander became tutor to five young
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
students, accompanying them to the University of Heidelberg.
Three years later he became rector of the Latin
school at D&uuml;sseldorf. This institution was under the supervision
of a Reformed pastor, Sylvester L&uuml;rsen, an able man,
but of contentious spirit. At first the two men worked
together harmoniously, Neander assisting with pastoral duties,
and preaching occasionally, although he was not ordained
as a clergyman. Later, however, he fell under the
influence of a group of separatists, and began to imitate
their practices. He refused to receive the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
on the grounds that he could not partake of it with the
unconverted. He induced others to follow his example. He
also became less regular in his attendance at regular worship,
and began to conduct prayer meetings and services of his own.</p>
<p>In 1676 the church council of D&uuml;sseldorf investigated his
conduct and dismissed him from his office. Fourteen days
after this action was taken, however, Neander signed a declaration
in which he promised to abide by the rules of the
church and school, whereupon he was reinstated.</p>
<p>There is a legend to the effect that, during the period
of his suspension from service, he spent most of his time
living in a cave in the beautiful Neanderthal, near Mettmann,
on the Rhine, and that he wrote some of his hymns
at this place. It is a well-established fact that Neander&rsquo;s
great love for nature frequently led him to this place, and
a cavern in the picturesque glen still bears the name of
&ldquo;Neander&rsquo;s Cave.&rdquo; One of the hymns which tradition declares
was written in this cave bears the title &ldquo;Unbegreiflich
Gut, Wahrer Gott alleine.&rdquo; It is a hymn of transcendent
beauty. One of the stanzas reads:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Thee all the mountains praise;</p>
<p class="t0">The rocks and glens are full of songs of Thee!</p>
<p class="t">They bid me join my lays,</p>
<p class="t0">And laud the mighty Rock, who, safe from every shock,</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath Thy shadow here doth shelter me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Many of Neander&rsquo;s hymns are odes to nature, but there
is always a note of praise to nature&rsquo;s God. Witness, for
instance:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Heaven and earth, and sea and air,</p>
<p class="t0">All their Maker&rsquo;s praise declare;</p>
<p class="t0">Wake, my soul, awake and sing,</p>
<p class="t0">Now thy grateful praises bring!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here behold me, as I cast me,&rdquo; a penitential hymn by
Neander, has found favor throughout all Christendom.</p>
<p>In 1679 Neander&rsquo;s spiritual friend, Pastor Under-Eyck,
invited him to come to Bremen and become his assistant in
St. Martin&rsquo;s church. Although his salary was only 40
thalers a year and a free house, Neander joyfully accepted
the appointment. The following year, however, he became
sick, and after a lingering illness passed away May 31, 1680,
at the age of only thirty years.</p>
<p>During his illness he experienced severe spiritual struggles,
but he found comfort in the words, &ldquo;It is better to hope
unto death than to die in unbelief.&rdquo; On the day of his
death he requested that Hebrews 7:9 be read to him. When
asked how he felt, he replied: &ldquo;The Lord has settled my
account. Lord Jesus, make also me ready.&rdquo; A little later
he said in a whisper: &ldquo;It is well with me. The mountains
shall be moved, and the hills shall tremble, yet
the grace of God shall not depart from me, and His covenant
of peace shall not be moved.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c15" title="A Roman Mystic and Hymn-writer">
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<h3>A ROMAN MYSTIC AND HYMN-WRITER</h3>
<p>In Johann Scheffler we have the singular
example of a man who forsook the Lutheran Church
to become a Romanist, but whose hymns have been
adopted and sung by the very Church he sought to oppose
and confound.</p>
<p>Scheffler was a contemporary of Gerhardt and Neander.
He was born in Breslau, Silesia, in 1624. His father,
Stanislaus Scheffler, was a Polish nobleman who had been
compelled to leave his native land because of his Lutheran
convictions. Young Scheffler became a medical student at
Strassburg, Leyden, and Padua, returning to Oels, Silesia,
in 1649 to become the private physician to Duke Sylvius
Nimrod of W&uuml;rttemberg-Oels.</p>
<p>During his sojourn in foreign lands he had come in contact
with the writings of various mystics and he began to
lean strongly toward their teachings. At Oels he began to
flaunt his separatist views by absenting himself from public
worship and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. When the Lutheran authorities
refused to permit the publication of some poems he had
written, because of their strong mystical tendencies, Scheffler
resigned his office and betook himself to Breslau, where he
joined himself to a group of Jesuits. Here he pursued the
study of the medieval mystics of the Roman Catholic
Church, and in 1653 was confirmed as a member of that
communion. At this time he took the name of Angelus
Silesius, probably after a Spanish mystic named John ab
Angelis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>In 1661 he was ordained a priest of the Roman Church.
He became a prolific writer and took special delight in directing
bitter polemics against the Church of his childhood.
Of these writings, it has been well said: &ldquo;He certainly
became more Roman than the Romans; and in his more than
fifty controversial tractates, shows little of the sweetness and
repose for which some have thought he left the Lutheran
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scheffler, however, was a poet of the first rank. His
poems, always tinged by the spirit of mysticism, sometimes
attain to sublime heights, and again they descend to a coarse
realism, particularly when he describes the terrors of judgment
and hell.</p>
<p>His hymns, on the other hand, are almost uniformly of a
high order. They are marked by a fervent love for Christ
the heavenly Bridegroom, although the imagery, largely
based on the Song of Solomon, is sometimes overdrawn, almost
approaching the sensual. Few of his hymns reveal his
Catholic tendencies, and therefore they were gladly received
by the Protestants. Indeed, they came into more general
use among the Lutherans than among the Catholics. They
were greatly admired by Count von Zinzendorf, who included
no less than 79 of them in his Moravian collection.</p>
<p>The mysticism of Scheffler often brought him dangerously
near the border-line of pantheism. Vaughn, in his &ldquo;Hours
with the Mystics,&rdquo; compares Scheffler with Emerson, and
declares that both resemble the Persian Sufis. Something of
Scheffler&rsquo;s pantheistic ideas may be seen in the following
lines:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God in my nature is involved,</p>
<p class="t">As I in the divine;</p>
<p class="t0">I help to make His being up,</p>
<p class="t">As much as He does mine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And again in this:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am as rich as God; no grain of dust</p>
<p class="t0">That is not mine, too: share with me He must.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Duffield, commenting on these astonishing lines, observes,
&ldquo;We need not wonder that this high-flown self-assumption
carried him to the door of a Jesuit convent. It is in the very
key of much that passes with Romanist theology for heavenly
rapture and delight in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pantheistic views of Scheffler may be discerned even
in his dying prayer: &ldquo;Jesus and Christ, God and man, bridegroom
and brother, peace and joy, sweetness and delight,
refuge and redemption, heaven and earth, eternity and time,
love and all, receive my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, we must agree with Albert Knapp in his judgment
of Scheffler&rsquo;s beautiful hymns, that &ldquo;whencesoever they
may come, they are an unfading ornament of the Church of
Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The gem among them is &ldquo;Thee will I love,
my Strength, my Tower.&rdquo; Others that have come into general
use are &ldquo;Earth has nothing sweet or fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thy soul,
O Jesus, hallow me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, follow me, the Saviour spake,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jesus, Saviour, come to me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou holiest Love, whom
most I love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loving Shepherd, kind and true.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>HYMN-WRITERS OF THE PIETIST SCHOOL</h3>
<p>Spiritual revivals in the Christian Church have
always been accompanied by an outburst of song.
This was true of the Reformation, which witnessed
the birth of the Lutheran Church, and it was also characteristic
of the Pietistic movement, which infused new life and
fervor into that communion. The Pietistic revival, which
in many respects was similar to the Puritan and Wesleyan
movements in England, had its inception in Germany in
the latter part of the 17th century and continued during the
first half of the 18th century. It quickly spread to other
Lutheran countries, particularly Scandinavia, and its influence
has been felt even to the present time.</p>
<p>The leader of the movement was Philipp Jacob Spener,
pastor of St. Nicolai Church, in Berlin. Spener, although
a loyal and zealous son of the Lutheran Church, was not
blind to the formalism and dead orthodoxy which had overtaken
it following the Thirty Years&rsquo; War and which threatened
to dry up the streams of spiritual life. To stimulate
spiritual endeavor and personal piety, Spener and his followers
organized Bible study groups. They also encouraged
private assemblies for mutual edification. These were known
as <i>collegia pietatis</i>, which gave rise to the name, &ldquo;Pietists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>August Hermann Francke, the foremost disciple of Spener,
succeeded the latter as leader of the movement. The
University of Halle, where Francke was called as professor
in 1691, became the center of Pietism. Here Francke laid
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the foundations for the remarkable philanthropic and educational
institutions that made his name known throughout
the Christian world. It began in 1695 when the great-hearted
man opened a room in his own house for the instruction
of poor children. Within a few years he had
established his great orphanage, a high school, and a home
for destitute students. The orphans&rsquo; home was erected on
a site where there had been a beer and dancing garden.</p>
<p>When Francke began he had no money, nor did he receive
any support from the state, but as the marvelous work progressed
funds poured in from all quarters. In the year of
his death, 1727, more than 2,000 children were receiving
care and instruction from 170 teachers. Altogether, some
6,000 graduates of theology left Halle during Francke&rsquo;s
career, &ldquo;men imbued with his spirit, good exegetes, and devoted
pastors, who spread their doctrines all over Germany,
and in the early decades of the 18th century occupied a
majority of the pulpits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halle also became the cradle of the modern missionary
movement. From this place, in 1705, Bartholomew Ziegenbalg
and Henry Pl&uuml;tschau, were sent forth as the first
missionaries to India, nearly a century before William Carey
left England for the same field. At Halle the youthful
Count von Zinzendorf became a pupil under Francke and
received the inspiration that in later years led to the
establishment of the far-reaching missions of the Moravians.
To Halle the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, came
in 1738, shortly after his conversion in London, in order to
become more familiar with the teachings of Luther and the
Pietists.</p>
<p>The secret of the marvelous success of Francke&rsquo;s efforts
may be read in the simple inscription on the monument
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
erected to his memory in front of the famous orphanage at
Halle. It reads: &ldquo;He trusted in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Francke nor Spener were hymn-writers of note,
although each composed a few songs. The Pietist movement,
however, gave birth to a great revival in hymnody in
Germany, both in Lutheran and Reformed circles. At Halle
it was Johann Anastasius Freylinghausen who not only became
the representative hymnist of the Pietists, but also
succeeded Francke as head of the great Halle institutions.</p>
<p>Freylinghausen was a student at the University of Jena
when he first heard the preaching of Francke. Shortly
afterward he followed him to Halle, and in 1695 became
Francke&rsquo;s colleague. He preached at vesper services,
conducted midweek meetings, taught classes in the orphanage
school, and delivered lectures on homiletics. He served
without salary for ten years, since Francke was obliged to
use all his income for the support of his institutions of
mercy. In 1715 Freylinghausen married Francke&rsquo;s only daughter.
At her baptism as an infant he had been her sponsor,
and she had received his name, Johanna Anastasia. It was
after Francke&rsquo;s death in 1727 that the Halle institutions
reached their highest development under the direction of
Freylinghausen. When the latter died in 1739, he was
buried beside his beloved friend.</p>
<p>Freylinghausen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Geistreiches Gesangbuch&rdquo; became the
standard hymn-book of the Pietistic movement. The first
edition appeared in 1704 and contained 683 hymns. A second
hymn-book was published in 1714, containing 815 additional
hymns. The two collections were combined in 1741
by G. A. Francke and published as one hymn-book, containing
1,582 hymns and 600 tunes. Freylinghausen was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
author of forty-four of these hymns, and is also said to
have composed some of the melodies.</p>
<p>The hymns of Freylinghausen are the most worthy of all
those produced by the Pietistic school. They are marked
by genuine piety, depth of feeling, rich Christian experience,
and faithfulness in Scriptural expression. The tunes employed,
however, were often a distinct departure from the
traditional Lutheran chorales, and were not always suited to
congregational worship. Freylinghausen&rsquo;s most famous
hymn, &ldquo;O Jesus, Source of calm repose,&rdquo; was greatly admired
by John Wesley, who translated it into English in
1737. The so-called &ldquo;Jesus hymns,&rdquo; which reached their
greatest development among the Pietists, find their sweetest
expression in Freylinghausen&rsquo;s:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Who is there like Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Jesus, unto me?</p>
<p class="t0">None is like Thee, none above Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou art altogether lovely;</p>
<p class="t">None on earth have we,</p>
<p class="t">None in heaven like Thee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is not strange that from Halle, from whence such
mighty missionary influences flowed, should also go forth
the first Protestant missionary hymn. It was in 1750 that
Karl Heinrich von Bogatzky, while working among the
orphans of the Franckean institutions, wrote his famous
hymn, &ldquo;Awake, thou Spirit, who didst fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bogatzky, who came from a noble Hungarian family,
was disowned by his father when he chose to enroll as a
theological student at Halle rather than to prepare for a
career as an army officer. His health failed him, however,
and he was unable to enter the ministry. For many years
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
he devoted himself to hymn-writing and devotional literature.
He also traveled as a lay preacher. Because of his
noble birth he was able to exert a considerable influence in
the higher circles of German society. From 1746 to his
death in 1774, he lived at the Halle orphanage. He was
the author of some 411 hymns, but few of them possess the
poetic and spiritual fire of his missionary hymn. Two of its
glorious stanzas read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Awake, Thou Spirit, who didst fire</p>
<p class="t">The watchmen of the Church&rsquo;s youth,</p>
<p class="t0">Who faced the foe&rsquo;s envenomed ire,</p>
<p class="t">Who day and night declared Thy truth,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose voices loud are ringing still,</p>
<p class="t0">And bringing hosts to know Thy will.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O haste to help, ere we are lost!</p>
<p class="t">Send preachers forth, in spirit strong,</p>
<p class="t0">Armed with Thy Word, a dauntless host,</p>
<p class="t">Bold to attack the rule of wrong;</p>
<p class="t0">Let them the earth for Thee reclaim,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy heritage, to know Thy Name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Johann Jacob Rambach was another important hymn-writer
of this period. The son of a cabinet maker of Halle,
young Rambach attended the free school established by
Francke and came under the direct influence of the great
Pietist leader.</p>
<p>Like many a youth, however, he felt that his education was
complete at the age of thirteen years, at which time he left
school to work in his father&rsquo;s shop. The Lord, on the other
hand, seems to have had other plans for the lad, and it was
not long before young Rambach suffered a dislocated ankle.
Confined to his bed for several weeks, he again turned to
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
his books, and, before he had recovered, the desire to resume
his studies took possession of him.</p>
<p>Rambach eventually became one of the outstanding theologians
of Halle, as well as preacher at the school church.
In 1731 he removed to Giessen to become superintendent
and first professor of theology. Here he found conditions
vastly different from those at Halle. He was particularly
grieved over the fact that his preaching did not seem to bear
fruit. Often his efforts to bring about healthier spiritual
conditions met with opposition and scoffing on the part of
his adversaries. He died in 1735 at the early age of forty-two
years&mdash;from intense sorrow over the spiritual indifference
of his flock, so it has been said.</p>
<p>Rambach wrote many splendid hymns, among them the
confirmation hymn, &ldquo;Baptized into Thy Name most holy.&rdquo;
His fame rests principally on his work as a hymnologist,
however. During his life-time he published a number of
collections from all sources. These hymns were chosen with
fine discrimination, and Rambach was the first hymn editor
to make a distinction between hymns for congregational worship
and those particularly suited for private devotion.</p>
<p>The beautiful Advent hymn, &ldquo;Rejoice, all ye believers,&rdquo;
as well as the Epiphany hymn, &ldquo;O Saviour of our race,&rdquo;
also date from the Pietistic period. Both hymns apparently
were written in 1700 by Laurentius Laurentii, cantor and
director of music in the Lutheran cathedral at Bremen.
Laurentii was not only a splendid musician, but also a
hymn-writer of high order, and no less than thirty-four of
his hymns were included in the Freylinghausen collections.</p>
<p>Other hymnists of the Pietistic school include Christian
Scriver, writer of the famous devotional book, &ldquo;Seelenschatz;&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Gottfried Arnold, a noted church historian; Ernst
Gottlieb Woltersdorf, founder of an orphanage at Bunzlau,
and Christian Richter, a pious physician and an associate of
Francke. Few of their hymns, however, are in common
use today.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h3>THE W&Uuml;RTTEMBERG HYMN-WRITERS</h3>
<p>The Pietistic movement quickly made its influence felt
in all parts of Germany. In some quarters, especially
in the latter stages of the movement, it assumed
more radical forms. Sometimes it developed into emotionalism
and mysticism. The hymns were often of a subjective
type, which led the worshiper to think more about his own
inner processes and feelings than to direct his thoughts to
Him alone who can redeem and sanctify.</p>
<p>Some of the Pietistic hymnists, notably Woltersdorf,
were given to the use of inordinate language and even sensuous
descriptions for the purpose of arousing intense emotion.
In one of Woltersdorf&rsquo;s passion hymns, he dwells
morbidly on every detail of the physical sufferings of Christ,
and in another hymn he borrows Scheffler&rsquo;s figure which
likens the soul to a bee deriving sustenance from the crimson
wounds of Christ.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Pietistic hymn is exemplified in
its highest and noblest form in the writings of the so-called
W&uuml;rttemberg school of hymnists, the chief exponent of
which was Philipp Friedrich Hiller. W&uuml;rttemberg was
blessed with the famous scholar and theologian, Johann Albrecht
Bengel, whose sound doctrinal views and profound
understanding of human nature not only led to a healthy
development of Pietism in southern Germany, but also left
a lasting impression on all the theological students who came
under his influence at the training schools at Denkendorf,
near Esslingen. Hiller was one of these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Hiller&rsquo;s hymns and those of the other W&uuml;rttemberg
hymnists never indulge in the weak emotional effusions of
which the later Halle hymn-writers were often guilty.</p>
<p>Hiller was a man sorely tried in the school of adversity.
Shortly after he began his pastorate at Steinheim, in 1748,
he lost his voice and was unable to continue his pulpit duties.
However, he believed implicitly in the Pauline teaching that
&ldquo;to them that love God all things work together for good,&rdquo;
and, when his voice became silent, his spirit began to sing
hymns richer and sweeter than ever. Witness, for example,
the note of tenderness in the last stanza of his baptismal
hymn, &ldquo;God, in human flesh appearing&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Feeble is the love of mother,</p>
<p class="t">Father&rsquo;s blessings are as naught,</p>
<p class="t0">When compared, my King and Brother,</p>
<p class="t">With the wonders Thou hast wrought;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus it pleased Thy heavenly meekness;</p>
<p class="t">Pleasing also be my praise,</p>
<p class="t0">Till my songs of earthly weakness</p>
<p class="t">Burst into celestial lays.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hiller was a prolific writer, his hymns numbering no less
than 1,075 in all. Most of these were written for his devotional
book, &ldquo;Geistliches Liederk&auml;stlein,&rdquo; a work that holds
an honored place beside the Bible in many pious homes in
southern Germany. Indeed, it has been carried by German
emigrants to all parts of the world. It is related that when
a Germany colony in the Caucasus was attacked by a fierce
Circassian tribe about a hundred years ago, the parents cut
up their copies of the &ldquo;Liederk&auml;stlein&rdquo; and distributed its
leaves among their children who were being carried off into
slavery. Hiller&rsquo;s hymns, though simple in form and artless
in expression, have retained a strong hold on the people of
W&uuml;rttemberg and are extensively used to this day. Among
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the more popular are &ldquo;O boundless joy, there is salvation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jesus Christ as King is reigning,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Son of God,
we wait for Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hiller&rsquo;s rule for hymn-writing, as set forth in one of his
prefaces, could be followed with profit by many modern
writers of sentimental tendencies. He says: &ldquo;I have always
striven for simplicity. Bombastic expressions of a soaring
imagination, a commonplace and too familiar manner of
speaking of Christ as a brother, of kisses and embraces, of
individual souls as the particular Bride of Christ, of naive
and pet images for the Christ-child,&mdash;all these I have scrupulously
avoided, and serious-minded men will not blame
me if, in this respect, I have revered the majesty of our
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another representative of the W&uuml;rttemberg school was
Baron Christoph Carl Ludwig von Pfeil, a diplomat of high
attainments and noble, Christian character. In September,
1763, he was appointed by Frederick the Great as Prussian
ambassador to the Diets of Swabia and Franconia. He was
created a baron by Emperor Joseph II shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Pfeil began writing hymns at the age of eighteen years
and continued it as his chief diversion throughout life. He
was a prolific writer, his published hymns numbering about
850. He was a warm friend of Bengel, who wrote the introduction
to one of Pfeil&rsquo;s hymn collections. Pfeil wrote
hymns on various phases of civil life. His hymn on the
Christian home is typical:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O blest the house, whate&rsquo;er befall,</p>
<p class="t0">Where Jesus Christ is All in all;</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, if He were not dwelling there,</p>
<p class="t0">How poor and dark and void it were!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Silesian pastors, Johann Andreas Rothe and Johann
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Mentzer, also may be regarded as belonging to the more
conservative Pietistic hymn-writers. Rothe was pastor at
Berthelsdorf, having been brought there through the influence
of Count von Zinzendorf, who had heard him preach in
Silesia. The Moravian community of Herrnhut formed a
part of Rothe&rsquo;s parish, and he took a keen interest in the
activities of Zinzendorf and his followers. However, when
Rothe, in 1737, found it necessary to report to the ecclesiastical
authorities that the Moravians were deviating from
sound Lutheran doctrine, the friendship between him and
Zinzendorf ceased, and Rothe found it advisable to remove
to Thommendorf, where he died in 1758.</p>
<p>Rothe wrote approximately forty hymns, the most famous
of which is &ldquo;Now I have found the ground wherein.&rdquo; This
hymn was greatly admired by John Wesley and was translated
by him in 1740. Because it first appeared in the
Moravian hymn-book, the Lutherans suspected that Zinzendorf
was the author. Upon discovering that it was by
Rothe, they quickly adopted it. The first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now I have found the ground wherein</p>
<p class="t">My soul&rsquo;s sure anchor may remain:</p>
<p class="t0">The wounds of Jesus, for my sin</p>
<p class="t">Before the world&rsquo;s foundation slain;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose mercy shall unshaken stay</p>
<p class="t0">When heaven and earth are fled away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mentzer, who has given us the beautiful hymn, &ldquo;O
would, my God, that I could praise Thee,&rdquo; was born at
Jahmen, Silesia, in 1658. For thirty-eight years he was pastor
at Kemnitz, Saxony, at which place he wrote his hymns,
about thirty in number. There is an exalted strain in his
hymns of praise:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O all ye powers that He implanted,</p>
<p class="t">Arise, keep silence thus no more,</p>
<p class="t0">Put forth the strength that He hath granted,</p>
<p class="t">Your noblest work is to adore;</p>
<p class="t0">O soul and body, be ye meet</p>
<p class="t0">With heartfelt praise your Lord to greet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This hymn sometimes begins with the line, &ldquo;O that I
had a thousand voices.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c18" title="How a Great Organist Inspired Two Hymnists">
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h3>HOW A GREAT ORGANIST INSPIRED TWO HYMNISTS</h3>
<p>While all the hymn-writers of Germany in the early
part of the eighteenth century were more or less influenced
by the Pietistic movement, there were some
who nevertheless refused to be carried away by the emotional
extravagances of which some of the Halle song-writers
were often guilty. In the hymns of these more conservative
psalmists we find a happy blending of objective
teaching and a warm, personal faith that reminds us of the
earlier hymns of Gerhardt.</p>
<p>The chief representatives of this more typical Lutheran
school were Benjamin Schmolck, a beloved pastor and a poet
of rare ability, and Erdmann Neumeister, creator of the
Church Cantata. It was the age in which John Sebastian
Bach lived and wrought, and this prince of Lutheran organists,
whose title of &ldquo;high priest of church music&rdquo; has never
been disputed, gave of his musical genius to help make the
hymns of Schmolck and Neumeister immortal.</p>
<p>Next to Gerhardt, there is no German hymnist whose
name is so frequently found in hymn-books today as that of
Schmolck. Born at Brauchitzdorf, Silesia, where his father
was pastor, he was sent to school at Lauban at the age of
sixteen. After an absence of five years the young man returned
home and was invited to fill his father&rsquo;s pulpit. The
sermon he preached so pleased the father that he determined
to send him to the University of Leipzig to study for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
ministry. In 1697 he returned to Brauchitzdorf to be ordained
as his father&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<p>In 1702 Schmolck became pastor of Friedenskirche at
Schweidnitz, in Silesia. According to the terms of the Peace
of Westphalia in 1648, all of the churches in this district
had been turned over to the Catholics, and only a &ldquo;meeting-house,&rdquo;
built of timber and clay and without tower or
bells, was allowed to the Lutherans. Here Schmolck labored
patiently for thirty-five years under the most trying
circumstances, not even being permitted to administer communion
to the dying except by consent of the Catholic authorities.</p>
<p>Schmolck&rsquo;s hymns and spiritual songs, numbering 1,183
in all, brought him fame all over Germany. Many have
been translated into English. His fervent love for the Saviour
is beautifully reflected in the hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My Jesus, as Thou wilt!</p>
<p class="t">O may Thy will be mine!</p>
<p class="t0">Into Thy hand of love</p>
<p class="t">I would my all resign;</p>
<p class="t0">Through sorrow or through joy,</p>
<p class="t">Conduct me as Thine own,</p>
<p class="t0">And help me still to say,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;My Lord, Thy will be done!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Light of light, enlighten me,&rdquo; a noble hymn of praise
and adoration, has been happily wedded to a glorious chorale
by Bach. Other hymns that have won renown throughout
the Christian world include &ldquo;Open now thy gates of beauty,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Welcome, Thou Victor in the strife,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed Jesus, here
we stand,&rdquo; &ldquo;What our Father does is well,&rdquo; &ldquo;My God, I
know that I must die,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hallelujah, Lo, He wakes,&rdquo; &ldquo;My
truest Friend abides in heaven,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Precious Word from
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
God in heaven.&rdquo; The joyous spirit in many of Schmolck&rsquo;s
hymns may be seen reflected in the beautiful temple hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Open now thy gates of beauty,</p>
<p class="t">Zion, let me enter there.</p>
<p class="t0">Where my soul in joyful duty</p>
<p class="t">Waits for Him who answers prayer;</p>
<p class="t0">O how bless&egrave;d is this place,</p>
<p class="t0">Filled with solace, light, and grace!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Neumeister followed the example of Schmolck in becoming
an ardent champion of the older, conservative Lutheranism.
Although he was greatly influenced as a youth by
the writings of Francke, he later became convinced that
there were dangerous tendencies in the Halle and Herrnhut
movements, and he did not hesitate to issue violent polemics
against them.</p>
<p>His hymns, on the other hand, offer a curious contrast to
his other writings. Often they reveal a warmth and tenderness
of feeling that would have merited a place for them in
any Pietistic hymn-book. This may be seen in the hymn,
&ldquo;Jesus sinners doth receive,&rdquo; which has also been translated
&ldquo;Sinners may to Christ draw near:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus sinners doth receive!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">Word of surest consolation;</p>
<p class="t0">Word all sorrow to relieve,</p>
<p class="t">Word of pardon, peace, salvation!</p>
<p class="t0">Naught like this can comfort give:</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus sinners doth receive!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Neumeister became pastor of St. James church in Hamburg
in 1715, where he remained for forty-one years until
his death in 1756. His fame does not rest merely upon his
hymns, although he wrote 650 in all, but Neumeister will
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
also be remembered as the originator of the Church Cantata.
In this new field of musical art he was fortunate in having
the co&ouml;peration of such a genius as Bach.</p>
<p>Bach belonged to the fifth generation of a remarkable
family of musicians. As many as thirty-seven of the family
are known to have held important musical positions. John
Sebastian, who is by far the greatest musician the Protestant
Church has produced, was born in Eisenach, on
March 21, 1685. The greater part of his life was spent
in Leipzig, where he labored from 1723 until his death in
1750 as cantor of the Thomas school and director of music
at the Thomas and Nicolai churches.</p>
<p>Bach&rsquo;s devotion to the Lutheran Church has been likened
to that of Palestrina to the Catholic Church. There is no
loftier example of musical genius dedicated to the service of
the Christian religion than we find in the life of Bach. He
felt that his life was consecrated to God, to the honor of his
Church, and to the blessing of mankind. Although it was
the age when the opera was flourishing in Europe, Bach
gave no attention to it, but devoted all his remarkable talent
to church music.</p>
<p>As master of the organ, Bach has never been equaled.
His chorales and passion music also belong in a class by
themselves. A famous critic has written: &ldquo;Mozart and
Beethoven failed in oratorio, Schubert in opera; the Italian
operas of Gluck and Handel have perished. Even in the
successful work of these men there is a strange inequality.
But upon all that Bach attempted&mdash;and the amount of his
work is no less a marvel than its quality&mdash;he affixed the
stamp of final and inimitable perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the passing of years, Bach&rsquo;s genius is being recognized
more and more throughout the Christian Church.
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
The performance of his cantatas by the Catholic Schola Cantorum
of Paris &ldquo;is one of the many testimonies to the universality
of the art of this son of Lutheranism.&rdquo; There is
something in his mighty productions that touches the deepest
chords of religious emotion, regardless of creed or communion.</p>

<div id="c19" title="Gerhard Tersteegen, Hymn-writer and Mystic">
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h3>GERHARD TERSTEEGEN, HYMN-WRITER AND MYSTIC</h3>
<p>While Benjamin Schmolck must be regarded as the
greatest of Lutheran hymn-writers in Germany during
the eighteenth century, Gerhard Tersteegen holds
the same distinction among German Reformed hymnists.
Except for the Wesleys in England, no man during his age
exerted so great a spiritual influence in evangelical circles
of all lands as did Tersteegen. In some respects his religious
views bordered on fanaticism, but no one could question
his deep sincerity and his earnest desire to live the life hidden
with Christ in God.</p>
<p>Born at M&ouml;rs, Rhenish Prussia, November 25, 1697,
Tersteegen was only six years old when his father died. It
had been the plan of his parents that he should become a Reformed
minister, but the death of the father made it impossible
for the mother to carry out this purpose. At the age
of sixteen he was apprenticed to a merchant, and four years
later entered business on his own account.</p>
<p>Although he was only twenty years old at this time, he began
to experience seasons of deep spiritual despondency.
This lasted for nearly five years, during which time he
changed his occupation to that of silk weaving, since he desired
more time for prayer and meditation. It was not until
the year 1724, while on a journey to a neighboring town,
that light seemed to dawn on his troubled soul, and he was
filled with the assurance that God&rsquo;s grace in Christ Jesus
was sufficient to atone for all sin. In the joy and peace
which he had found, he immediately wrote the beautiful
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
hymn, &ldquo;How gracious, kind and good, my great High
Priest, art Thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time until the close of his life, Tersteegen
began to devote his energies more and more to religious work
and literary activities. An independent religious movement
known as &ldquo;Stillen im Lande&rdquo; had begun about this time,
and he soon became known as a leader among these people.</p>
<p>Tersteegen had already ceased to associate with his friends
in the Reformed Church, and had gone over to religious
mysticism. In one of his strange spiritual moods he wrote
what he called &ldquo;a covenant between himself and God&rdquo; and
signed it with his own blood.</p>
<p>Finally he gave up business pursuits entirely, and his home
became the refuge of multitudes of sick and spiritually
troubled people. It came to be known as the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Hut,&rdquo; from the fact that many found a temporary retreat
there, as well as spiritual help and guidance. Tersteegen
also traveled extensively in his own district, and made frequent
visits to Holland to hold meetings there.</p>
<p>Tersteegen never married, and for this reason he was accused
of teaching celibacy. Several sects, including the
Moravians, sought to induce him to become one of their
number, but he steadfastly refused to identify himself with
any organized church body. He died at M&uuml;lheim, April
30, 1769.</p>
<p>Tersteegen&rsquo;s hymns, as well as his other writings, reflect
his spirit of mysticism. His soul was imbued with the sense
of the nearness of God, and, through a life of spiritual communion
and a renunciation of the world, he developed a
simplicity of faith and a child-like trust that found beautiful
expression in his hymns.</p>
<p>Two of these, &ldquo;Thou hidden love of God whose height&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Lo, God is here, let us adore,&rdquo; made a deep impression
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
on John Wesley, who translated the former during his visit
to Georgia in 1736. Wesley became familiar with Tersteegen&rsquo;s
hymns through contact with Moravian pilgrims
who were crossing the Atlantic on the same ship on which
he sailed. &ldquo;Lo, God is here, let us adore&rdquo; has several English
versions, including &ldquo;God is in His temple&rdquo; and &ldquo;God
Himself is present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another of Tersteegen&rsquo;s hymns, &ldquo;God calling yet! shall
I not hear?&rdquo; is one of the most stirring calls to repentance
in all the realm of Christian hymnody. It was rendered into
English by Mrs. Sarah Borthwick Findlater in the series of
translations known as &ldquo;Hymns from the Land of Luther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other noted hymns by Tersteegen include &ldquo;Jesus, whom
Thy Church doth own,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Love divine, all else transcending,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Triumph, ye heavens,&rdquo; the latter a Christmas
lyric of exultant strain.</p>
<p>Tersteegen&rsquo;s conception of the high place which hymnody
should occupy in Christian worship is revealed in his writings.
He says: &ldquo;The pious, reverential singing of hymns
has something angelic about it and is accompanied by divine
blessing. It quiets and subdues the troubled emotions; it
drives away cares and anxieties; it strengthens, refreshes and
encourages the soul; it draws the mind unconsciously from
external things, lifts up the soul to joyful adoration, and thus
prepares us to worship in spirit and in truth. We should
sing with the spirit of reverence, with sincerity, simplicity
and hearty desire.... When you sing, O soul, remember
that you are as truly communing with the holy and omnipresent
God as when you are praying. Consider that you
are standing in spirit before the throne of God with countless
thousands of angels and spirits of the just and that you
are blending your weak praises with the music of heaven.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c20" title="Zinzendorf and Moravian Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h3>ZINZENDORF AND MORAVIAN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>The church of the Moravian Brethren is famous for
two things: its missionary zeal and its love for church
music. It owes both of these distinguishing characteristics
to its great founder and patron leader, Nicolaus
Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf. Not only was this very
unusual man a gifted writer of hymns, but he was also an
ardent exponent of foreign missions.</p>
<p>Zinzendorf was only ten years old when his soul was
fired with a passionate desire to do something to help win
the world for Christ. He was a pupil at the famous Pietist
school of Francke at Halle, Germany, at the time, and
through his endeavors a mission society known as &ldquo;The
Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed,&rdquo; was organized among
the lads of his own age.</p>
<p>A few years later he chanced to see a copy of Sternberg&rsquo;s
masterpiece, &ldquo;Ecce Homo,&rdquo; depicting Christ wearing His
crown of thorns before Pilate and the Jewish mob. Beneath
the famous picture were inscribed the words:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This have I done for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">What hast thou done for Me?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>From that moment Zinzendorf took as his life motto:
&ldquo;I have but one passion, and that is He and only He.&rdquo; On
his wedding day, in 1722, he and his young bride decided
to renounce their rank and to dedicate their lives to the task
of winning souls for Christ.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The Lord took them at their word. In that same year
a number of Protestant refugees from Moravia, who had
been compelled to leave their homes because of Roman Catholic
persecution, arrived in Saxony and found refuge on
Zinzendorf&rsquo;s large estate. They were a remnant of the Bohemian
Brethren, a heroic religious communion which dated
back to the days of the noble martyr, John Huss. Though
relentlessly hunted and persecuted for more than three centuries,
this early evangelical body had continued to maintain
its existence in the form of secret religious circles known
as &ldquo;the hidden seed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the protection of Count Zinzendorf, the little
band of Moravian refugees established a religious center
which they called &ldquo;Herrnhut.&rdquo; Zinzendorf, who was a Lutheran,
induced them to adopt the Augsburg Confession as
a statement of their doctrine, but they continued to exist as
an independent church body. People from all over Europe,
hearing that religious freedom was enjoyed on the Zinzendorf
estates, flocked to Herrnhut in large numbers to escape
persecution, and it soon became a flourishing colony.</p>
<p>In 1737 Zinzendorf accepted ordination as a bishop of the
Brethren, and thus became the real leader of the organization.
He immediately began to impart his own missionary
zeal to the Moravian movement. Two of the earliest missionaries,
David Nitschmann and Leonard Dober, were sent
to the island of St. Thomas, in the West Indies, to preach
the gospel to the negro slaves. The blacks were so embittered
because of the cruel treatment received at the hands of
their taskmasters that they refused to listen to the missionaries,
and very little progress could be made. At last, in order
to gain their confidence, Dober sold himself as a slave
and shared their hardships with them. He soon died, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
as a result of this deed. The story of his heroic sacrifice
so moved the heart of Prime Minister Wilberforce of
England that he forthwith determined to begin the movement
which eventually led to the emancipation of all slaves
in the British empire.</p>
<p>Missionary zeal continued to flourish among the Moravians,
and the little colony of Herrnhut became known as
one of the most famous missionary centers of Christendom.
Every one of its members felt that he possessed no permanent
habitation in this world, and was prepared every day
to be sent to any part of the globe.</p>
<p>Though still a small organization today, the Moravian
Church has never lost its missionary spirit. It is claimed
that for every fifty-eight members of the Church at home,
there is one missionary in foreign lands. When Carey went
to India, the Moravians already had 165 missionaries in the
pagan world.</p>
<p>Zinzendorf was a great lover of music. Even as a boy,
he wrote hymns. The first was written at the age of twelve,
and he was still producing hymns in 1760, the year of his
death. Altogether, he is credited with the authorship of
more than 2,000 lyrics. His most famous is &ldquo;Jesus, still
lead on,&rdquo; which is also known as &ldquo;Jesus, lead the way.&rdquo;
John Wesley was a great admirer of Zinzendorf&rsquo;s hymns
and has given us the beautiful English translation of &ldquo;Jesus,
thy blood and righteousness.&rdquo; James Montgomery, the
noted English hymnist, was a member of the Moravian communion.</p>

<div id="c21" title="Two Famous Hymns and Some Legends">
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h3>TWO FAMOUS HYMNS AND SOME LEGENDS</h3>
<p>Every hymn has a story. Ofttimes, however, the
origin is obscure, and it is difficult to trace its birth
out of the misty past. Again there are so many
legends that have gathered around the great lyrics of the
ages, many of them generally accepted, that it becomes a
painful process to get rid of these excrescences. Two beautiful
German hymns, &ldquo;Sch&ouml;nster Herr Jesu&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stille
Nacht! Heilige Nacht!&rdquo; may serve to illustrate these difficulties.</p>
<p>In innumerable hymn-books the former hymn, sometimes
translated &ldquo;Beautiful Saviour&rdquo; and sometimes &ldquo;Fairest Lord
Jesus,&rdquo; is designated as &ldquo;The Crusaders&rsquo; Hymn.&rdquo; The
hymn was first introduced to American worshipers by
Richard Storrs Willis, who included it in his &ldquo;Church
Chorals and Choir Studies,&rdquo; published in 1850. It was accompanied
with this explanation: &ldquo;This hymn, to which
the harmony has been added, was lately (1850) discovered
in Westphalia. According to the traditionary text by which
it is accompanied, it was wont to be sung by the German
knights on their way to Jerusalem. The only hymn of the
same century which in point of style resembles this is one
quoted by Burney from the Chatelaine de Coucy, set about
the year 1190, very far inferior, however, to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a London hymn-book, &ldquo;Heart Melodies&rdquo; by Morgan
and Chase, the same error is repeated. There it is referred
to as &ldquo;Crusader&rsquo;s Hymn of the Twelfth Century. This air
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
and hymn used to be sung by the German pilgrims on their
way to Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these statements,&rdquo; writes James Mearns, &ldquo;there does
not seem to be the shadow of foundation, for the air referred
to has not been traced earlier than 1842, nor the words than
1677.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn appeared anonymously in the &ldquo;M&uuml;nster
Gesangbuch&rdquo; of 1677, where it was published as the first
of &ldquo;Three beautiful selected new hymns.&rdquo; In a book of
Silesian folk songs, published in Leipzig in 1842, the text is
found in altered form and the beautiful melody to which it
is now sung is given for the first time. Both text and melody,
it is explained in this book, were taken down from oral
recitation in the district of Glaz, in lower Silesia. From
these facts we are compelled to draw the conclusion that this
glorious hymn of adoration to the Saviour probably dates
back to the seventeenth century, while the melody is undoubtedly
a Silesian folk song of much later origin.</p>
<p>The English translation, &ldquo;Beautiful Saviour,&rdquo; has come
to us from the pen of Joseph A. Seiss, the noted Lutheran
preacher of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silent night, holy night&rdquo; also is a hymn around which
numerous legends have clustered. The most unfortunate of
these deals with its origin. According to this story, the hymn
was written on a Christmas Eve by a &ldquo;Mr. Mohr,&rdquo; whose
wife that very day had gone to celebrate Christmas in heaven.
In an adjoining room the grief-stricken husband and father
could see his little motherless children sleeping. Outside the
house of mourning the stillness of the night was broken suddenly
by the singing of Christmas carolers. They were
singing the very songs his wife and children used to sing.
Now, he thought, she is blending her voice with the angels.
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Then came the inspiration for the hymn, and in a few moments
he had penned the now famous &ldquo;Stille Nacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a very touching story, but its fatal defect lies in
the fact that &ldquo;Mr. Mohr&rdquo; was a Roman Catholic priest.</p>
<p>The true story of the origin of the hymn has much less
of the emotional appeal. The author, Joseph Mohr, was
born at Salzburg, Austria, December 11, 1792. He was ordained
as a priest at the age of twenty-three, becoming assistant
at Laufen, near his native city. It was here, three
years later, that the beautiful Christmas carol was written.</p>
<p>It seems that a shipowner at Oberndorf named Maier and
his wife had invited the young priest to be their guest at
a pre-Christmas party. As a special surprise for the priest,
Maier had invited some wandering minstrels to stage a
crude representation of the Christmas story as recounted in
the Bible. The thoughtful hospitality of the Maier couple
and the touching simplicity of the festival play so stirred the
heart of Mohr that, instead of going straightway home, he
climbed the so-called &ldquo;Totenberg,&rdquo; (mountain of the dead)
overlooking Oberndorf, and stood in silent meditation.</p>
<p>The silence of the night, the starry splendor of the winter
sky, the murmur of the Salzach river thrilled his soul.
Quickly he descended to his parish house, and late that
night wrote the words of &ldquo;Stille Nacht.&rdquo; The next day he
hurried to his friend and co-worker, Franz Gruber, organist
and school teacher, and asked him to write music for his
lines. The latter eagerly embraced the opportunity, and
thus was given to the world one of the most exquisite of
Christmas carols.</p>

<div id="c22" title="Hymnody in the Age of Rationalism">
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h3>HYMNODY IN THE AGE OF RATIONALISM</h3>
<p>In religion, as in other things, the pendulum often
swings from one extreme to the other. Scarcely had
the Pietistic movement run its course before the
rationalistic tendencies which had thrown religious thought
into confusion in France and England began to make their
appearance in Germany. Rationalism was an attempt to
subject all revealed religion to the test and judgment of the
human reason. That which seemed to contradict reason was
rejected as superstitious and untrue.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the University of Halle, which had
been the citadel of Pietism, became the stronghold of Rationalism
in Germany. Christian Wolff and Johann Semler,
noted philosophers of Halle, were leaders in the movement.
It was not their purpose to establish a new religion
of reason, but to &ldquo;purge&rdquo; Christianity of the things that
seemed unreasonable. But the results of the movement were
devastating. The miracles of the Bible that could not be explained
by natural causes were rejected as &ldquo;fables.&rdquo; Christ
was robbed of His glory as a divine Saviour and was regarded
only as a teacher of morals. Religion became merely
the knowledge of God and the pursuit of virtue. What remained
of Christianity was a mere shadow: a hypothesis
concerning God and immortality, and a teaching of external
morality, the attainment of which was largely a matter of
man&rsquo;s own efforts.</p>
<p>Rationalism cast its blight over the hymnody of all Europe,
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
but particularly in Germany. It was the golden age
of German literature, but such geniuses as Goethe, Schiller,
Lessing and Wieland were not filled with the Christian
zeal of earlier poets, and they wrote no hymns. Most of the
hymns that were produced were so tinged with the spirit of
the &ldquo;new theology&rdquo; that they contained no elements of vitality
to give them permanent value.</p>
<p>The Rationalists were not satisfied with criticizing the Bible;
they also sought to &ldquo;purge&rdquo; the hymn-books. The old
hymns of Luther, Heermann, Selnecker, and Gerhardt were
so completely altered that a noted German hymnologist, Albert
Knapp, was moved to observe ironically: &ldquo;The old
hymns were subjected to a kind of transmigration of soul by
which their spirits, after having lost their own personality,
entered into other bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a few writers, such as Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock,
Balthasar M&uuml;nter, Christian Gellert and Matthias Claudius,
wrote hymns of any abiding worth.</p>
<p>Klopstock, the German Milton, whose epic, &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo;
thrilled Germany as had no other poetic work in centuries,
essayed to write a few hymns, but he soared too high. His
hymns lacked simplicity of style and were too emotional and
subjective to be used for public worship. Only two English
translations are familiar&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed are the heirs of
heaven,&rdquo; a funeral hymn, and &ldquo;Grant us, Lord, due preparation,&rdquo;
a communion hymn.</p>
<p>Klopstock spent nearly twenty years of his life at the
Danish court, having been invited there by King Fredrik V
through the influence of Count von Bernstorff, who had
become greatly interested in the epic, &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo; The Danish
monarch gave the poet an annual pension in order to
assist him in completing his famous poem without being oppressed
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
by financial worries. In 1770 Klopstock returned
to Hamburg, where he died in 1803.</p>
<p>Gellert, who was born in Hainichen, Saxony, July 4,
1715, intended to become a Lutheran pastor. After completing
his theological course at the University of Leipzig,
however, he found it difficult to deliver sermons without
the use of a manuscript, and therefore decided to take up
teaching. In 1745 he became a member of the faculty of
the University of Leipzig, where he remained until his
death in 1769. Among his pupils were many famous men
of Germany, including Goethe and Lessing.</p>
<p>Gellert&rsquo;s hymns, although influenced by the age in which
he lived, are singular for their genuine, evangelical utterance.
It is said that he never attempted to write a hymn
except when he was in the proper frame of mind, and only
after a season of prayer. His Easter hymn, &ldquo;Jesus lives!
thy terrors now,&rdquo; has gained great popularity, both in England
and in America. In the former country it has been
sung at the funerals of some of England&rsquo;s greatest churchmen.
His communion hymn also breathes a spirit of true
faith in Christ:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Crushed by my sin, O Lord, to Thee</p>
<p class="t">I come in my affliction:</p>
<p class="t0">O full of pity, look on me,</p>
<p class="t">Impart Thy benediction.</p>
<p class="t0">My sins are great, where shall I flee?</p>
<p class="t0">The blood of Jesus speaks for me;</p>
<p class="t">For all my sins He carried.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Matthias Claudius, the author of the splendid hymn,
&ldquo;We plow the fields and scatter,&rdquo; like Gellert, had intended
to prepare himself for the Lutheran ministry. While attending
the University of Jena, however, the Rationalistic
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
teachings with which he came in contact caused him to lose
interest in religion, and he decided to take up journalism
instead. In 1777 he became editor of a newspaper at Darmstadt,
at which place he became acquainted with Goethe and
a group of freethinking philosophers.</p>
<p>Stricken by a serious illness, Claudius began to realize
something of the spiritual emptiness of the life he had been
living, and in his hour of need he turned again to his childhood
faith. When he had recovered, he gave up his position
and removed to Wandsbeck, where he edited the
&ldquo;Wandsbecker Bote&rdquo; in a true Christian spirit.</p>
<p>In the life-story of Claudius we may discern something
of the reaction that was already taking place in many quarters
against the deadening influence of Rationalism. Men
were hungering for the old evangel of salvation, and there
were evidences everywhere of the dawn of a happier day.
Although Claudius&rsquo; poems were not essentially Church
hymns, they were lyrics that seemed to strike anew some
of the strings of Gerhardt&rsquo;s harp. This is seen especially
in his surpassingly beautiful ode to evening, &ldquo;The silent
moon is risen,&rdquo; written in the same spirit and meter as Gerhardt&rsquo;s
famous evening hymn. The first stanza has been
translated:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The silent moon is risen,</p>
<p class="t0">The golden star-fires glisten</p>
<p class="t">In heaven serene and bright;</p>
<p class="t0">The forest sleeps in shadow,</p>
<p class="t0">And slowly off the meadow</p>
<p class="t">A mist is curling, silver-white.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another stanza, reflecting something of Claudius&rsquo; own spiritual
groping and, at the same time, confessing the futility
of all human efforts to attain moral perfection, reads:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We, poor, frail mortals, groping,</p>
<p class="t0">Half fearing and half hoping,</p>
<p class="t">In darkness seek our way;</p>
<p class="t0">Our airy cobwebs spinning</p>
<p class="t0">With erring and with sinning,</p>
<p class="t">Far from the mark we sadly stray.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the lyrics of Claudius we may observe a transition from
the spiritually impoverished hymn production of the rationalistic
period to a new type of hymnody, giving expression
to the old rugged faith in a more elegant form. Men&rsquo;s
souls could no longer be satisfied with the dry husks of
philosophical speculation and were turning again to the
Bread of God which cometh down from heaven and giveth
life unto the world.</p>
<p>Balthasar M&uuml;nter was another faithful witness to the
truth in this unhappy age of widespread skepticism and unbelief.
Born at L&uuml;beck in 1735, he became Lutheran court
pastor at Gotha and afterwards of the German Church of
St. Peter in Copenhagen. He was the writer of about 100
hymns, many of which were set to tunes composed for them
by the greatest musicians of the day. Among the best known
hymns of M&uuml;nter are &ldquo;Lord, Thou Source of all perfection,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Full of reverence, at Thy Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;Behold the man!
how heavy lay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Woe unto him who says, There is
no God.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>HYMNS OF THE SPIRITUAL RENAISSANCE</h3>
<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century a great spiritual
revival swept over Germany and other parts of
evangelical Europe. In some respects it resembled
the earlier Pietistic movement in Germany and the Wesleyan
revival in England, except that it was more conservative
than either. In Germany the old orthodox conservatives
and the more radical Pietists joined forces to fight Rationalism,
and the union was of benefit to both groups.</p>
<p>There were many influences that contributed to the overthrow
of Rationalism. Chief among these was the widespread
suffering and distress in Germany, both physical and
spiritual, following the Napoleonic wars. Jacobs has well
said: &ldquo;When earthly props fall and temporal foundations
crumble, men turn, almost perforce, to God.&rdquo; The downfall
of Napoleon and the great empire he had founded was
an object lesson to the world of the transitory character of
all things material.</p>
<p>The great thinker, Immanuel Kant, also helped to undermine
the walls of Rationalism by pointing out the limitatations
of the human reason. He was followed by the famous
theologian, Friedrich Schleiermacher, who taught that
the seat of religion is not to be found in either the reason or
will, but in feeling&mdash;&ldquo;the feeling of absolute dependence
upon God.&rdquo; The way was thus paved for the zealous efforts
of Claus Harms, who in 1817, the 300th anniversary
of the Reformation, published a new set of ninety-five theses
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
and called upon his countrymen to return again to the pure
evangelical teachings of Luther.</p>
<p>Spring-time always brings song-birds and flowers. It was
spring-time in the religious life of Germany, and the sweet
notes of evangelical hymnody again were heard throughout
the land.</p>
<p>Carl Johann Philipp Spitta was the greatest German
hymn-writer of the nineteenth century. He was born August
1, 1801, in Hannover. His father, who was a descendant
of a Huguenot family that fled from France during the
Catholic persecutions, died when Carl was only four years
old. His mother was a Christian Jewess, and it is a beautiful
tribute to her fostering care that the finest hymn ever
written on the Christian home came from the pen of her son.
No doubt it was the memory of his childhood home that
led Spitta to write:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O happy home, whose little ones are given</p>
<p class="t">Early to Thee in humble faith and prayer,</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee, their Friend, who from the heights of heaven</p>
<p class="t">Guides them, and guards with more than mother&rsquo;s care.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Spitta began to write verse at the age of eight. It was his
mother&rsquo;s ambition that he should study for the ministry, but,
because of his frail health, it was decided that he should become
a watchmaker, and a younger brother was sent to
school instead. The latter died, however, and now Carl
was given his opportunity. He completed his theological
studies in 1824, taught school for four years in L&uuml;ne, and
in 1828 he was ordained to the Lutheran ministry.</p>
<p>During his university days, Spitta had become a bosom
friend of Heinrich Heine, the famous poet and prose writer.
When the latter visited Spitta at L&uuml;ne, however, and
scoffed at holy things in the presence of Spitta&rsquo;s pupils, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
friendship came to an abrupt end. It was about this time
that Spitta passed through a deep spiritual experience, the
result of which was the composition of some of his finest
hymns. Writing to a friend in 1826, he says, &ldquo;In the manner
in which I formerly sang, I sing no more. To the Lord
I dedicate my life, my love, and likewise my song. He gave
to me song and melody. I give it back to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spitta&rsquo;s hymns aroused unparalleled enthusiasm. His
&ldquo;Psalter und Harfe,&rdquo; first published in 1833, appeared in
a second and larger edition the following year. Thereafter
a new edition appeared every year, and by 1889 no less than
fifty-five editions had been published. A second collection
of hymns was printed in 1843, and by 1887 it had passed
through forty-two editions. The popularity of Spitta&rsquo;s
hymns also spread to other lands, and a large number are
found in English and American hymn-books.</p>
<p>Spitta&rsquo;s child-like faith and his fervent love to the Saviour
may be seen reflected in such a hymn as:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I know no life divided,</p>
<p class="t">O Lord of life, from Thee:</p>
<p class="t0">In Thee is life provided</p>
<p class="t">For all mankind and me;</p>
<p class="t0">I know no death, O Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">Because I live in Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy death it is that frees us</p>
<p class="t">From death eternally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other well-known hymns from this consecrated writer are
&ldquo;O come, Eternal Spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;By the holy hills surrounded,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I place myself in Jesus&rsquo; hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou, whose coming seers
and sages,&rdquo; &ldquo;We are the Lord&rsquo;s: His all-sufficient merit,&rdquo;
&ldquo;How blessed from the bonds of sin,&rdquo; &ldquo;We praise and bless
Thee, gracious Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brethren, called by one vocation,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
&ldquo;Withhold not, Lord, the help I crave,&rdquo; &ldquo;O blessed Sun,
whose splendor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Say, my soul, what preparation.&rdquo;
The beloved German psalmist passed away suddenly while
seated at his desk, September 28, 1859.</p>
<p>Most noted among the contemporaries of Spitta was Albert
Knapp, who, although his hymns never met with the
popular favor that attended Spitta&rsquo;s efforts, nevertheless excelled
the latter as a poet. Knapp was born at T&uuml;bingen,
July 25, 1798, and was educated for the Lutheran ministry
in the University at that place. His most important post
after ordination was at St. Leonard&rsquo;s church in Stuttgart,
where he served from 1845 until his death in 1864.</p>
<p>Knapp was not only a hymnist but also a hymnologist.
Perhaps the greatest service he rendered his Church was the
editing of a collection of more than 3,000 of the great hymns
of Germany. This monumental work, known as &ldquo;Evangelischer
Lieder-Schatz,&rdquo; is the most comprehensive hymn
collection ever published in German, and is a veritable gold-mine
of the classics of Protestant hymnody. Knapp has been
severely criticized, however, for the liberties he took in revising
the hymns of some of the older writers. The best
known of his own works is a baptismal hymn, &ldquo;Father,
who hast created all.&rdquo; A hymn for church dedication begins
with the line, &ldquo;O God, whom we as Father know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carl Bernhard Garve, a Moravian pastor, also contributed
a number of compositions to the hymns of this period,
the best known of which is the beautiful tribute to
the Holy Scripture:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy Word, O Lord, like gentle dews,</p>
<p class="t">Falls soft on hearts that pine;</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, to Thy garden ne&rsquo;er refuse</p>
<p class="t">This heavenly balm of Thine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p class="t0">Watered by Thee, let every tree</p>
<p class="t">Forth-blossom to Thy praise,</p>
<p class="t0">By grace of Thine bear fruit divine</p>
<p class="t">Through all the coming days.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Garve served congregations in Amsterdam, Ebersdorf,
Berlin, and Neusalz. He spent the last years of his life in
Herrnhut, where he died in 1841. Garve was the most
important among the later Moravian hymn-writers. Many
of his hymns have been adopted by other communions, particularly
the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>To Friedrich Adolf Krummacher, a Reformed pastor, we
owe the highly prized hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou art the Way, the Truth, the Life from heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">This blest assurance Thou to us hast given;</p>
<p class="t0">O wilt Thou teach us, Lord, to win Thy pleasure</p>
<p class="t3">In fullest measure?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Krummacher was a teacher of theology in the Reformed
University of Duisburg. After the battle of Jena in 1806
Duisburg was taken from Prussia by Napoleon and the
salaries of the professors were cut off. Krummacher continued
to lecture, however, until his class consisted of one
student! He afterwards served as pastor in a number of
cities, finally accepting appointment to St. Ansgarius church
in Bremen. He died in Bremen in 1845.</p>
<p>Of the more modern hymn-writers of Germany the best
known is Karl von Gerok, chief court preacher at Stuttgart,
where he died as recently as 1890. An eloquent preacher
and able writer, he attained fame principally through the
publication in 1857 of a collection of poems known as
&ldquo;Palmbl&auml;tter.&rdquo; This work received a marvelous circulation
in Germany, and by 1916 no less than 130 editions had
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
been printed. Although most of Gerok&rsquo;s compositions are
poems rather than hymns, a few have found their way into
hymn-books. A devotional hymn by von Gerok reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy, blessed Lord,</p>
<p class="t">All the choirs of heaven now adore Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">O that I might join that great white host,</p>
<p class="t">Casting down their golden crowns before Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Look on me, a creature of the dust,</p>
<p class="t">Pity me, though I have naught of merit;</p>
<p class="t0">Let me bring to Thee for Jesus&rsquo; sake</p>
<p class="t">Humble praises of a contrite spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bend Thine ear, dear Lord, and hear my prayer;</p>
<p class="t">Cleanse me in Thy blood for sinners given;</p>
<p class="t0">Deck me in the robe of spotless white</p>
<p class="t">Thou hast promised to Thy bride in heaven.</p>

<div id="c24" title="The Swedish Reformers and Their Hymns">
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h3>THE SWEDISH REFORMERS AND THEIR HYMNS</h3>
<p>The Reformation fires kindled by Luther and his
contemporaries in Wittenberg spread with amazing rapidity
to all parts of Europe. In the year that Luther
nailed his famous theses on the chapel door at Wittenberg,
two brothers&mdash;Olavus and Laurentius Petri&mdash;arrived from
Sweden to study at the university made famous by Luther
and Melanchthon. They were sons of a village blacksmith
at &Ouml;rebro, Sweden.</p>
<p>In 1519 they returned to their native land, full of reforming
zeal. Olavus was the more fiery of the two brothers,
and he lost no time entering into the political and spiritual
storm that was threatening to break over their country. In
the Stockholm massacre the following year Olavus almost
lost his life when he cried out in protest at the cruel beheading
of his friend, the bishop of Strengn&auml;s. Only the intervention
of a Wittenberg acquaintance, who asserted that
Olavus was a German citizen, saved the young man from
a similar fate. The massacre had been instigated by Roman
intrigue.</p>
<p>Olavus preached boldly against the sale of indulgences
and other abuses of the papal church, and, when the Swedish
revolution placed Gustavus Vasa on the throne in 1523, the
young reformer found a powerful ally in the new monarch.
Despite protests of the ecclesiastical authorities, the king
ordered a pulpit placed in the cathedral church of Stockholm
and gave Olavus permission to preach to the populace in
the native tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The following year the two brothers were summoned
to appear before the papal authorities at Upsala, but, when
neither threats nor bribes could induce them to desist from
their high-minded purpose, they were placed under the ban.
This, however, made them only the more determined to
carry out their Reformation plans.</p>
<p>Laurentius Andreae, archdeacon of Strengn&auml;s, also had been
converted to the principles of the Reformation and powerfully
espoused the cause championed by the Petri brothers.
In 1523 he was appointed by Gustavus Vasa as chancellor
to the king, and it was largely through his influence that
the Lutheran teachings were approved by the Diet af Vester&aring;s
in 1527. The younger of the Petri brothers, Laurentius,
was named Archbishop of Upsala, Primate of Sweden, in
1531.</p>
<p>The Swedish reformers were apt pupils of Luther and
quickly made use of the same spiritual weapons in their own
country that he had found so effective in Germany. It is
significant that the Word of God and a hymn-book in the
vernacular were given to the Swedish people in the same
year. It was in 1526 that Laurentius Andreae published
his translation of the New Testament in Swedish, and simultaneously
Olavus Petri issued a little hymn-book entitled,
&ldquo;Swedish Hymns or Songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This marked the beginning of evangelical hymnody in
Sweden. The little book contained only ten hymns, five
of which are believed to have been original productions of
Olavus Petri himself, and the other five translations from
Luther&rsquo;s first hymn-book of 1524. Although no copy of
the first Swedish hymn-book is now known to exist, it is
believed that Petri&rsquo;s beautiful hymn, &ldquo;Our Father, merciful
and good,&rdquo; appeared in this historic collection. It occurs
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
in a second edition, called &ldquo;A Few Godly Songs Derived
from Holy Writ,&rdquo; published by the Swedish reformer in
1530. A few fragmentary pages of this hymn-book were
discovered in 1871.</p>
<p>How far Olavus Petri had imbibed the spirit of Luther
is reflected not only by the fiery zeal with which he proclaimed
the doctrines of the Reformation in Sweden, but
also in the character of his hymns. &ldquo;Our Father, merciful
and good&rdquo; is so strongly suggestive of Luther&rsquo;s style that
it was regarded for a long time as a translation of one of
Luther&rsquo;s hymns. It is now known that there is no such
hymn of German origin.</p>
<p>Most of Petri&rsquo;s hymns, however, are translations of German
or Latin originals. One of these is the beautiful Advent
hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now hail we our Redeemer,</p>
<p class="t">Eternal Son of God,</p>
<p class="t0">Born in the flesh to save us,</p>
<p class="t">And cleanse us in His blood.</p>
<p class="t0">The Morning Star ascendeth,</p>
<p class="t0">Light to the world He lendeth,</p>
<p class="t">Our Guide in grief and gloom.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although this hymn was translated by Petri from the
German, it is believed that it dates back to a Latin hymn
by Ambrose in the fourth century. Another of Latin origin
is the glad Easter hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blest Easter day, what joy is thine!</p>
<p class="t0">We praise, dear Lord, Thy Name divine,</p>
<p class="t0">For Thou hast triumphed o&rsquo;er the tomb;</p>
<p class="t0">No more we need to dread its gloom.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Petri, like Luther, never ceased praising God for restoring
His Word to the Church through the Reformation. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
may be seen in one of his more polemic hymns, which is
regarded as original. A translation by Ernst W. Olson
reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy sacred Word, O Lord, of old</p>
<p class="t">Was veiled about and darkened,</p>
<p class="t0">And in its stead were legends told,</p>
<p class="t">To which the people harkened;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Word, for which the people yearned,</p>
<p class="t">The worldlings kept in hiding,</p>
<p class="t0">And into human fables turned</p>
<p class="t">Thy truth, the all-abiding.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now thanks and praise be to our Lord,</p>
<p class="t">Who boundless grace bestoweth,</p>
<p class="t0">And daily through the sacred Word</p>
<p class="t">His precious gifts forthshoweth.</p>
<p class="t0">His Word is come to light again,</p>
<p class="t">A trusty lamp to guide us;</p>
<p class="t0">No strange and divers teachings then</p>
<p class="t">Bewilder and divide us.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last hymn-book published by Olavus Petri appeared
in 1536. It contained some thirty new hymns, most of
them translations from German sources. In addition to his
labors in the realm of hymnody, Petri must also be credited
with the authorship of the Swedish Church-Book, which
appeared in 1529. He was the creator of the liturgy of
the Church of Sweden.</p>
<p>His hymnological endeavors were continued by his brother
Laurentius, who, as archbishop, brought out in 1567, and
later in 1572, the most important of all the earlier hymn-books
of the Swedish Church. Laurentius is sometimes
given the title, &ldquo;Father of Swedish hymnody,&rdquo; but the honor
more rightly belongs to his older brother, Olavus.</p>
<p>The latter years of Olavus were darkened through an
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
unfortunate misunderstanding with the Swedish king. As
a consequence of the reformer&rsquo;s sturdy opposition to Gustavus
Vasa&rsquo;s plan to make himself the head of the Church, he
fell into royal disfavor. When a plot against the king&rsquo;s life
was discovered in 1540, Olavus was convicted of having
guilty knowledge of it, and was condemned to die. Through
the intervention of the populace of Stockholm, he was pardoned,
but the king never forgave him. He was permitted
to resume his work in 1543, and continued to preach the
gospel with great zeal until his death in 1552.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Jesper Swedberg</span> (1653-1735).</p>
</div>
<div id="c25" title="A Hymn-book That Failed">
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h3>A HYMN-BOOK THAT FAILED</h3>
<p>When the Swedish colonists along the Delaware
gathered in their temples to worship God in the
latter part of the 17th century, they sang songs from
a hymn-book the use of which had been prohibited in Sweden.
It was the much-mooted hymn-book of Jesper Swedberg.
Originally published by the author in 1694 and intended
for the Church of Sweden, it immediately came
under suspicion on the ground that it contained unorthodox
teachings and was promptly confiscated. This, however,
did not hinder the authorities from sending the book in
large quantities to America, and it was used on this side
of the Atlantic for many years.</p>
<p>Swedberg, who was born near Falun, Sweden, in the year
1653, was the first important hymnist of his native land.
From the days of the Reformation no noteworthy advance
had been made in Swedish hymnody until Swedberg began
to tune his lyre. The official &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; had been revised
on several occasions, but the Upsala edition of 1645
contained only 182 hymns, far too few to meet the needs
of church worship and private devotion.</p>
<p>It was in 1691 that Swedberg received the royal commission
to prepare a new hymn-book. He was fortunate in
having the aid of such gifted poets as Haqvin Spegel, Petrus
Lagerl&ouml;f, Israel Kolmodin and Jacob Boethius in the execution
of his task.</p>
<p>The new book, containing 482 Swedish hymns and a
few in Latin, made its appearance in 1694. A large edition
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
was printed, the financial cost of which was borne largely
by Swedberg himself. It met with immediate opposition,
particularly from Bishop Carl Carlsson, who charged that
the hymn-book contained &ldquo;innumerable heresies of a theological,
anthropological, Christological, soteriological and
eschatological nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was enough. King Karl XI immediately appointed
a new commission to revise Swedberg&rsquo;s work, with the result
that 75 hymns were omitted and six new hymns added. It
was printed in 1696 and remained in use as the &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo;
of the Church of Sweden for more than a century,
until it was succeeded in 1819 by Wallin&rsquo;s masterpiece.</p>
<p>The unsold copies of the first edition, about 20,000 in
number, were confiscated and stored away. From time to
time quantities of these books were sent to the Swedish colonists
in America, for whose &ldquo;preservation in the true faith,&rdquo;
as the hymnologist S&ouml;derberg ironically remarks, &ldquo;the Swedish
authorities seemed less concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swedberg felt the slight keenly and often made significant
references in his diary regarding those who had been instrumental
in rejecting his work. One of these notations
tells how the Cathedral of Upsala was destroyed by fire
in 1702, and how the body of Archbishop O. Svebilius, although
encased in a copper and stone sarcophagus, was reduced
to ashes. &ldquo;But my hymn-books,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;which
were only of paper, unbound and unprotected, were not
even scorched by the flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final form in which his hymn-book was published
nevertheless still retained so many of his own hymns, and
the entire book was so impregnated with his own spirit, that
it has always been known as &ldquo;Swedberg&rsquo;s Psalm-book.&rdquo;
A noted critic has called it &ldquo;the most precious heritage he
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
left to his native land.&rdquo; It was Swedberg who wrote the
sublime stanza that has become the doxology of the Church
of Sweden:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bless us, Father, and protect us,</p>
<p class="t">Be our souls&rsquo; sure hiding-place;</p>
<p class="t0">Let Thy wisdom still direct us,</p>
<p class="t">Light our darkness with Thy grace!</p>
<p class="t0">Let Thy countenance on us shine,</p>
<p class="t0">Fill us all with peace divine.</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the Father, Son, and Spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him all that life inherit!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Swedberg was elevated to the bishopric of Skara in 1702.
He died in 1735, universally mourned by the Swedish people.</p>
<p>Haqvin Spegel, who collaborated with Swedberg in the
preparation of his hymn-book, was the more gifted poet of
the two. It was he who, by his hymns, fixed the language
forms that subsequently became the model for Swedish
hymnody. Although Spegel never stooped to sickly sentimentality,
his hymns are so filled with the spirit of personal
faith and fervent devotion that they rise to unusual lyric
heights. A sweet pastoral fragrance breathes through the
hymn, &ldquo;We Christians should ever consider,&rdquo; as
the following stanza testifies:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The lilies, nor toiling nor spinning,</p>
<p class="t">Their clothing how gorgeous and fair!</p>
<p class="t0">What tints in their tiny orbs woven,</p>
<p class="t">What wondrous devices are there!</p>
<p class="t0">All Solomon&rsquo;s stores could not render</p>
<p class="t0">One festival robe of such splendor</p>
<p class="t">As modest field lilies do wear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>His communion hymn, &ldquo;The death of Jesus Christ, our
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
Lord,&rdquo; is a classic example of how Spegel could set forth
in song the objective truths of the Christian faith.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The death of Jesus Christ, our Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">We celebrate with one accord;</p>
<p class="t0">It is our comfort in distress,</p>
<p class="t0">Our heart&rsquo;s sweet joy and happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He blotted out with His own blood</p>
<p class="t0">The judgment that against us stood;</p>
<p class="t0">He full atonement for us made,</p>
<p class="t0">And all our debt He fully paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">That this is so and ever true</p>
<p class="t0">He gives an earnest ever new,</p>
<p class="t0">In this His Holy Supper, here</p>
<p class="t0">We taste His love, so sweet, so near.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For His true body, as He said,</p>
<p class="t0">And His own blood, for sinners shed,</p>
<p class="t0">In this communion we receive:</p>
<p class="t0">His sacred Word we do believe.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O sinner, come with true intent</p>
<p class="t0">To turn to God and to repent,</p>
<p class="t0">To live for Christ, to die to sin,</p>
<p class="t0">And thus a holy life begin.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Spegel was given the highest ecclesiastical honor bestowed
by his country when he was created archbishop in 1711. He
died three years later.</p>
<p>Among the other hymn-writers who contributed hymns
to Swedberg&rsquo;s noted book was Jacob Arrhenius, professor
of history in the University of Upsala. This man, who
devoted a great deal of his time to the financial affairs of
the University, was also a richly-endowed spiritual poet.
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
The intimate tenderness with which he sang the Saviour&rsquo;s
praise had never before been attained in Swedish hymnody.
It was he who wrote:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus is my Friend most precious,</p>
<p class="t">Never friend did love as He;</p>
<p class="t0">Can I leave this Friend so gracious,</p>
<p class="t">Spurn His wondrous love for me?</p>
<p class="t0">No! nor friend nor foe shall sever</p>
<p class="t">Me from Him who loves me so;</p>
<p class="t0">His shall be my will forever,</p>
<p class="t">There above, and here below.</p>

<div id="c26" title="David&rsquo;s Harp in the Northland">

<h3>DAVID&rsquo;S HARP IN THE NORTHLAND</h3>
<p>When Longfellow translated Tegn&eacute;r&rsquo;s Swedish poem,
&ldquo;Children of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,&rdquo; he introduced Johan
Olof Wallin to the English-speaking world in
the following lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t9">And with one voice</p>
<p class="t0">Chimed in the congregation, and sang an anthem immortal</p>
<p class="t0">Of the sublime Wallin, of David&rsquo;s harp in the Northland.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wallin is Scandinavia&rsquo;s greatest hymnist and perhaps the
foremost in the entire Christian Church during the Nineteenth
century. The Swedish &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; of 1819, which
for more than a century has been the hymn-book of the
Swedish people in the homeland and in other parts of the
world, is in large measure the work of this one man. Of
the 500 hymns in this volume, 128 are original hymns from
his pen, 178 are revisions by Wallin, twenty-three are his
translations, and thirteen are semi-originals based on the
hymns of other authors. In brief, no less than 342 of the
hymns of the &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; reflect the genius of this remarkable
writer.</p>
<p>Early in life Wallin began to reveal poetic talent. Born
at Stora Tuna, Dalarne province, in 1779, he overcame the
handicaps of poverty and poor health and at the age of
twenty-four he had gained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
at the University of Upsala. In 1805, and again in
1809, he won the chief prize for poetry at the University.</p>
<p>In 1806 he was ordained to the Lutheran ministry. Very
soon he began to attract attention by his able preaching. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
1812 he was transferred to Stockholm, and in 1816 he became
dean of Vester&aring;s. In 1824 he was elevated to the
bishopric, and thirteen years later became Primate of the
Church of Sweden when he was made Archbishop of Upsala.
He died in 1839.</p>
<p>As early as 1807 Wallin had begun to publish collections
of old and new hymns. He possessed the rare ability of
translating sacred poetry of other lands in such a way that
often the translation excelled the original in virility and
beauty.</p>
<p>In 1811 a commission was appointed by the Swedish parliament
to prepare a new hymn-book to succeed that of Jesper
Swedberg, which had been in use for more than a century.
Wallin was made a member of this body. Within
three years the commission presented its labors in the form
of a first draft. However, it did not meet with universal
favor, nor was Wallin himself satisfied with the result. By
this time Wallin&rsquo;s genius had been revealed so clearly that
the commission was moved to charge him with the entire
task of completing the &ldquo;Psalm-book.&rdquo; He gladly undertook
the work and on November 28, 1816, he was able to
report that he had finished his labors. A few minor changes
were subsequently made, but on January 29, 1819, the new
hymn-book was officially authorized by King Karl XIV. It
has remained in use until the present day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Wallin&rsquo;s hymns have not become generally
known outside of his own native land. It is only in recent
years that a number have been translated into English.
One of these is his famous Christmas hymn, which for more
than a century has been sung in every sanctuary in Sweden
as a greeting to the dawn of Christmas day. The first
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
stanza reflects something of the glory of the Christmas
evangel itself:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All hail to thee, O blessed morn!</p>
<p class="t0">To tidings long by prophets borne</p>
<p class="t">Hast thou fulfilment given.</p>
<p class="t0">O sacred and immortal day,</p>
<p class="t0">When unto earth, in glorious ray,</p>
<p class="t">Descends the grace of heaven!</p>
<p class="t3">Singing,</p>
<p class="t3">Ringing</p>
<p class="t3">Sounds are blending,</p>
<p class="t3">Praises sending</p>
<p class="t3">Unto heaven</p>
<p class="t">For the Saviour to us given.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although Wallin reverenced the old traditional hymns
of the Church in spite of their many defects in form and
language, he was unrelenting in his demand that every new
hymn adopted by the Church should be tested by the severest
classical standards. &ldquo;A new hymn,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;aside
from the spiritual considerations which should never be compromised
in any way, should be so correct, simple and lyrical
in form, and so free from inversions and other imperfections
in style, that after the lapse of a hundred years a father may
be able to say to his son, &lsquo;Read the Psalm-book, my boy,
and you will learn your mother tongue!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The profound influence which Wallin&rsquo;s hymns have exerted
over the Swedish language and literature for more
than a century is an eloquent testimony, not only to his
poetic genius, but also to the faithfulness with which he adhered
to the high standards he cherished.</p>
<p>The charge has sometimes been made that a number of
Wallin&rsquo;s hymns are tinged by the spirit of rationalism. It
is true that in his earlier years the great Swedish hymnist
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
was strongly influenced by the so-called &ldquo;New Theology,&rdquo;
which had swept over all Europe at that time. His poems
and hymns from this period bear unmistakable marks of
these rationalizing tendencies. Even some of the hymns in
the first part of the &ldquo;Psalm-book,&rdquo; dealing with the person
and attributes of God, are not entirely free from suspicion.</p>
<p>However, as Wallin became more and more absorbed in
his great task, his own spiritual life seems to have been deepened
and a new and richer note began to ring forth from
his hymns. In 1816 this change was made manifest in an
address Wallin delivered before the Swedish Bible Society,
in which he declared war on rationalism and the &ldquo;New
Theology,&rdquo; and took his stand squarely upon the faith and
confessions of the Lutheran Church. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far had we traveled in what our age termed &lsquo;enlightenment&rsquo;
and another age shall call &lsquo;darkness,&rsquo; that the very
Word of God ... was regarded as a sort of contribution
to the ancient history which had already served its purpose
and was needed no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atonement of Christ now became the central theme
in his hymn-book, the pure evangelical tone of which may be
heard in one of his own hymns:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is a truth so dear to me,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll hold it fast eternally,</p>
<p class="t0">It is my soul&rsquo;s chief treasure:</p>
<p class="t0">That Jesus for the world hath died,</p>
<p class="t0">He for my sins was crucified&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">O love beyond all measure!</p>
<p class="t0">O blessed tidings of God&rsquo;s grace,</p>
<p class="t0">That He who gave the thief a place</p>
<p class="t0">To paradise will take me</p>
<p class="t0">And God&rsquo;s own child will make me!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Kind Shepherd, Son of God, to Thee</p>
<p class="t0">Mine eyes, my heart, so yearningly,</p>
<p class="t0">And helpless hands are lifted.</p>
<p class="t0">From Thee I strayed; ah, leave me not,</p>
<p class="t0">But cleanse my soul from each dark blot,</p>
<p class="t0">For I am sore afflicted.</p>
<p class="t0">A wandering sheep, but now restored,</p>
<p class="t0">Ah, bear me to Thy fold, dear Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">And let me leave Thee never,</p>
<p class="t0">O Thou who lovest ever!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again we find him giving expression to faith&rsquo;s certainty
in a stanza that has become very dear to the Swedish people:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blessed, blessed he who knoweth</p>
<p class="t">That his faith on Thee is founded,</p>
<p class="t0">Whom the Father&rsquo;s love bestoweth</p>
<p class="t">Of eternal grace unbounded,</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus Christ, to every nation</p>
<p class="t">A Redeemer freely given,</p>
<p class="t0">In whose Name is our salvation,</p>
<p class="t">And none else in earth or heaven.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The poetic utterance and exalted language of Wallin&rsquo;s
hymns made him the hymnist <i>par excellence</i> for festival days,
as witness the quotation above from his Christmas hymn and
the following stanza from his Ascension hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To realms of glory I behold</p>
<p class="t">My risen Lord returning;</p>
<p class="t0">While I, a stranger on the earth,</p>
<p class="t">For heaven am ever yearning.</p>
<p class="t0">Far from my heavenly Father&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid toil and sorrow here I roam.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>His metrical version of the <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i> is also
an impressive example of the poetic genius of this master
psalmist:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jehovah, Thee we glorify,</p>
<p class="t0">Ruler upon Thy throne on high!</p>
<p class="t2">O let Thy Word</p>
<p class="t2">Through all the earth be heard.</p>
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou carest gently for Thy flock;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Church, firm-founded on the Rock,</p>
<p class="t2">No powers dismay</p>
<p class="t2">Until Thy dreadful day.</p>
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All nations, in her fold comprised,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall bow their knees unto the Christ,</p>
<p class="t2">All tongues shall raise</p>
<p class="t2">Their orisons and praise:</p>
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Around Thy throne the countless throng</p>
<p class="t0">At last in triumph swell the song,</p>
<p class="t2">When Cherubim</p>
<p class="t2">Shall answer Seraphim:</p>
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although a hymn usually loses much of its original expression
in translation, something of the rare beauty in Wallin&rsquo;s
poetry is still apparent in the following:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Where is the Friend for whom I&rsquo;m ever yearning?</p>
<p class="t0">My longing grows when day to night is turning;</p>
<p class="t0">And though I find Him not as day recedeth,</p>
<p class="t3">My heart still pleadeth.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">His hand I see in every force and power,</p>
<p class="t0">Where waves the harvest and where blooms the flower;</p>
<p class="t0">In every breath I draw, my spirit burneth:</p>
<p class="t3">His love discerneth.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When summer winds blow gently, then I hear Him;</p>
<p class="t0">Where sing the birds, where rush the streams, I&rsquo;m near Him;</p>
<p class="t0">But nearer still when in my heart He blesses</p>
<p class="t3">Me with caresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O where such beauty is itself revealing</p>
<p class="t0">In all that lives, through all creation stealing,</p>
<p class="t0">What must the Source be whence it comes, the Giver?</p>
<p class="t3">Beauty forever!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other noble hymns by the Swedish archbishop recently
translated into English include &ldquo;Behold, the joyful day is
nigh,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guardian of pure hearts,&rdquo; &ldquo;I know in Whom I
trust,&rdquo; &ldquo;Great joy and consolation,&rdquo; &ldquo;He lives! O fainting
heart, anew,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mute are the pleading lips of Him,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thine
agony, O Lord, is o&rsquo;er,&rdquo; &ldquo;A voice, a heavenly voice I hear,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Heavenly Light, benignly beaming,&rdquo; &ldquo;Father of lights,
eternal Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;In my quiet contemplation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jerusalem, lift
up thy voice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus, Lord and precious Saviour,&rdquo; &ldquo;O
blessed is the man who stays,&rdquo; &ldquo;O let the children come to
Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Strike up, O harp and psaltery,&rdquo; &ldquo;Watch, my soul
and pray,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Again Thy glorious sun doth rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wallin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; has aroused the greatest admiration
wherever it has become known. The hymnologists
of Germany, including Mohnike, Knapp, Weiss and Wackernagel,
have given it undivided praise. Mohnike declared,
&ldquo;This is undoubtedly the most excellent hymn-book in the
entire Evangelical Church, and, if translated, it would become
the hymn-book for all Christian people.&rdquo; Knapp concurs
by saying, &ldquo;The Scriptural content of this book is
clothed in the most beautiful classical language; there is
nothing in Evangelical Germany to equal it.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div id="c27" title="The Golden Age of Swedish Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<h3>THE GOLDEN AGE OF SWEDISH HYMNODY</h3>
<p>Archbishop Wallin was not alone in the preparation
of that masterpiece of Northern hymnody
known as the &ldquo;Swedish Psalm-book of 1819.&rdquo; Although
the lion&rsquo;s share of the task fell to the lot of the gifted
psalmist, he was aided by a number of the greatest spiritual
poets in Scandinavian history. It was the golden age in
Swedish hymnody, when such men as Franz&eacute;n, Hedborn,
Geijer, &Aring;str&ouml;m, Afzelius and Nystr&ouml;m were singing &ldquo;the
glories of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foremost in this unusual group was the beloved Frans
Michael Franz&eacute;n, a lyric poet of singular talent. Born at
Uleaborg, Finland, in 1772, he held a number of positions
at the University of &Aring;bo, and later removed to Sweden,
where he became pastor of St. Clara church, in Stockholm,
and eventually Bishop of Hern&ouml;sand. He died in 1847.</p>
<p>Franz&eacute;n early became associated with Wallin and exerted
a strong influence over the latter. Though not as
prolific a writer as Wallin, the hymns of Franz&eacute;n are rich
in content and finished in form. Because of their artless
simplicity it has been said that &ldquo;the cultured man will
appreciate them and the unlettered man can understand them.&rdquo;
Among the most popular are two evening hymns&mdash;&ldquo;The
day departs, yet Thou art near&rdquo; and &ldquo;When vesper bells
are calling.&rdquo; The latter is a hymn of solemn beauty:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When vesper bells are calling</p>
<p class="t">The hour of rest and prayer,</p>
<p class="t0">When evening shades are falling,</p>
<p class="t">And I must hence repair,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p class="t0">I seek my chamber narrow,</p>
<p class="t">Nor my brief day deplore,</p>
<p class="t0">For I shall see the morrow,</p>
<p class="t">When night shall be no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O take me in Thy keeping,</p>
<p class="t">Dear Father, good and just,</p>
<p class="t0">Let not my soul be sleeping</p>
<p class="t">In sin, and pride, and lust.</p>
<p class="t0">If in my life Thou guide me</p>
<p class="t">According to Thy will,</p>
<p class="t0">I may in death confide me</p>
<p class="t">Into Thy keeping still.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The voice of gracious invitation heard in Franz&eacute;n&rsquo;s communion
hymn, &ldquo;Thine own, O loving Saviour,&rdquo; has called
millions of hungering souls to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. His
hymn for the first communion of catechumens, &ldquo;Come, O
Jesus, and prepare me,&rdquo; is also regarded as the most appealing
of its kind in Swedish hymnody. The stirring note in
his hymn of repentance, &ldquo;Awake, the watchman crieth,&rdquo;
reveals Franz&eacute;n as a poet of power and virility as well as
a writer of the more meditative kind. The same solemn
appeal, although expressed in less severe language, is also
heard in his other call to repentance:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ajar the temple gates are swinging,</p>
<p class="t">Lo! still the grace of God is free.</p>
<p class="t0">Perhaps when next the bells are ringing</p>
<p class="t">The grave shall open unto thee,</p>
<p class="t0">And thou art laid beneath the sod,</p>
<p class="t0">No more to see this house of God.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Franz&eacute;n was recently accorded a unique honor in America
when his soul-gripping Advent hymn, &ldquo;Prepare the way,
O Zion,&rdquo; was made the opening hymn in the Hymnal of
the Augustana Synod. This hymn-book contains more translations
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of Swedish hymns than any other volume published
in America.</p>
<p>When we add to the hymns already mentioned such beautiful
compositions as &ldquo;Thy scepter, Jesus, shall extend,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look to Jesus Christ thy Saviour,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The little while
I linger here,&rdquo; it will readily be understood why Franz&eacute;n
ranks so high among the foremost hymnists of the North.</p>
<p>To Samuel Johan Hedborn, another of Wallin&rsquo;s contemporaries,
posterity will ever be grateful for &ldquo;Holy Majesty,
before Thee,&rdquo; a magnificent hymn of praise that for loftiness
of poetic sentiment and pure spiritual exaltation has
probably never been excelled. The first stanza suggests something
of the heavenly beauty of this noble hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy Majesty, before Thee</p>
<p class="t0">We bow to worship and adore Thee;</p>
<p class="t">With grateful hearts to Thee we sing.</p>
<p class="t0">Earth and heaven tell the story</p>
<p class="t0">Of Thine eternal might and glory,</p>
<p class="t">And all Thy works their incense bring.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, hosts of Cherubim</p>
<p class="t0">And countless Seraphim</p>
<p class="t4">Sing, Hosanna,</p>
<p class="t0">Holy is God, almighty God,</p>
<p class="t0">All-merciful and all-wise God!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hedborn, who was the son of a poverty-stricken Swedish
soldier, was born in Heda, Sweden, in the year 1783.
He began his career as a school teacher, served for a while
as court preacher, and finally became pastor at Askeryd,
where he died in 1849. He was a gifted writer, and his
lyric poetry and folk-songs struck a responsive chord in
Swedish hearts. In 1812 he published a collection of hymns,
and in the following year a second volume appeared. It is
claimed that the Christo-centric note in Hedborn&rsquo;s hymns
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
profoundly influenced Wallin and helped to establish the
latter in the orthodox Lutheran teaching.</p>
<p>In addition to the sublime <i>Te Deum</i> mentioned above,
two other hymns of Hedborn have been given English
dress. One of these is the beautiful Epiphany hymn, &ldquo;Now
Israel&rsquo;s hope in triumph ends&rdquo;; the other is the communion
hymn, &ldquo;With holy joy my heart doth beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erik Gustav Geijer, professor of history in Upsala University,
was another of the poetic geniuses of this golden
age in Swedish hymnody. He was born at Rans&auml;ter, V&auml;rmland,
Sweden, in the same year that witnessed Hedborn&rsquo;s
birth&mdash;1783. Like Hedborn, he also published a little collection
of hymns in 1812 which immediately focused attention
upon him as a poet of unusual ability. Although his
hymns do not rise to the artistic heights attained by his
other poems, it is believed that Geijer purposely avoided
high-sounding phrases as unworthy of the dignity and spirit
of hymnody.</p>
<p>His passion hymn, &ldquo;Thy Cross, O Jesus, Thou didst
bear,&rdquo; is a gripping portrayal of the conquering power of
the Saviour&rsquo;s sacrificial love. There is likewise a glorious
note of victory heard in his Easter hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In triumph our Redeemer</p>
<p class="t">Is now to life returned.</p>
<p class="t0">All praise to Him who, dying,</p>
<p class="t">Hath our salvation earned!</p>
<p class="t0">No more death&rsquo;s fetter galls us,</p>
<p class="t0">The grave no more appalls us,</p>
<p class="t">For Jesus lives again.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In glory Thou appearest,</p>
<p class="t">And earth is filled with light;</p>
<p class="t0">With resurrection radiance</p>
<p class="t">The very tomb is bright;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s joy in heavenly places</p>
<p class="t0">When o&rsquo;er all earthly races</p>
<p class="t">The dawn of mercy breaks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the preparation of the &ldquo;Psalm-book,&rdquo; there was no
one on whom Archbishop Wallin leaned so heavily for help
and counsel as Johan &Aring;str&ouml;m, parish priest in Simtuna and
Altuna. This man, who was born in 1767, was a lyric poet
of unusual ability, and Wallin valued his judgment very
highly, even to the extent of seeking his criticism of his own
hymns. Eighteen of the hymns in the &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; are
from &Aring;str&ouml;m&rsquo;s pen. Many of them, however, are unfortunately
tinged by the spirit of rationalism, from which influence
&Aring;str&ouml;m had not quite been able to free himself. Instead
of emphasizing trust in the Saviour&rsquo;s merits as the
true way to eternal life, there is a strong suggestion in
&Aring;str&ouml;m&rsquo;s hymns that the heavenly goal is achieved by walking
in the Saviour&rsquo;s footsteps. Witness, for example:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, disperse the mists of error,</p>
<p class="t">In Thy light let me see light;</p>
<p class="t0">Give Thou me that faith and visior</p>
<p class="t">Whereby I may walk aright,</p>
<p class="t0">In my Saviour&rsquo;s path discerning,</p>
<p class="t">Through this vale of doubt and strife,</p>
<p class="t">Footsteps to eternal life.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We are immeasurably indebted to &Aring;str&ouml;m, however, for
the present form of the glorious All Saints&rsquo; hymn, &ldquo;In heaven
above, in heaven above.&rdquo; This hymn, in which we almost
may discern something of the celestial radiance and
beauty of the heavenly country, is ranked as one of the finest
hymns in the Swedish &ldquo;Psalm-book.&rdquo; It is more than three
centuries old, dating back in its original form to 1620. It
was written by L. Laurentii Laurinus, parish pastor in
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
H&auml;radshammar, at the time of his wife&rsquo;s death, and was
appended to the funeral sermon preached by a brother pastor.
&Aring;str&ouml;m recognized the rare beauty of the hymn and through
his poetic genius it was clothed in immortal language. William
Maccall, a Scotchman, has in turn rendered it into
English in such a faithful manner that much of its original
beauty is preserved.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In heaven above, in heaven above,</p>
<p class="t">Where God our Father dwells:</p>
<p class="t0">How boundless there the blessedness!</p>

<p>Arvid Afzelius, court chaplain and pastor at Enk&ouml;ping,
was another member of this remarkable group of Swedish
hymnists that contributed to the &ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; of Wallin.
Afzelius, who was an authority on folk songs, has given us
the inspiring hymn of praise beginning:</p>
<div class="bq">

<p class="t0">The power and riches of His grace.</p>

</div>
<p>Johan Hjert&eacute;n, an obscure country pastor at Hellstad,
was the author of six hymns in the &ldquo;Psalm-book,&rdquo; among
them the devotional hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, in my walk and living.&rdquo;
It is said that the artless simplicity of his hymns provided
an excellent pattern for the other writers of his day, many
of whom were fond of the grandiloquent phrases so characteristic
of the rationalist hymnody.</p>
<p>The last name of this group we would mention is that
of a layman, Per Olof Nystr&ouml;m. This man, who was a
high naval officer, wrote many excellent hymns, among them
a devotional lyric that for more than a hundred years has
been cherished almost as a national prayer by the pious folk
of Sweden. Its first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">

<div id="c28" title="The Fanny Crosby of Sweden and the Pietists">
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h3>THE FANNY CROSBY OF SWEDEN AND THE PIETISTS</h3>
<p>As will be noted in a subsequent chapter, the Nineteenth
century witnessed the phenomenon of gifted
Christian women assuming a place of primary importance
among the foremost hymn-writers of the Church.
Just as England had its Charlotte Elliott and Frances
Havergal, and America had its Fanny Crosby, so Sweden
had its Lina Sandell.</p>
<p>The rise of women hymn-writers came simultaneously
with the great spiritual revival which swept over America
and evangelical Europe in successive tidal waves from 1800
to 1875. In Sweden the religious renaissance received its
first impulse, no doubt, from Lutheran Germany. However,
the Wesleyan movement in England and America also
began to make its influence felt in wider circles, and the
coming to Stockholm of such a man as George Scott, an
English Methodist, gave added impetus to the evangelical
movement which was already under way. Carl Olof Rosenius,
Sweden&rsquo;s greatest lay preacher and the most prominent
leader in the Pietistic movement in that country, was
one of Scott&rsquo;s disciples, although he remained faithful to the
Lutheran doctrine and a member of the Established Church
to the close of his life.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of the Rosenius movement that Lina
Sandell became known to her countrymen as a great song-writer.
She was born October 3, 1832, at Fr&ouml;deryd, her
father being the parish pastor at that place. She was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
frail child who preferred to spend her hours in her father&rsquo;s
study rather than join her comrades in play. When she
was twenty-six years old, she accompanied him on a journey
to Gothenburg, but they never reached their destination.
At H&auml;stholmen the vessel on which they sailed gave a sudden
lurch and the father fell overboard, drowning before
the eyes of his devoted daughter.</p>
<p>This tragedy proved a turning point in Lina Sandell&rsquo;s life.
In the midst of her grief she sought comfort in writing
hymns. Her songs seemed to pour forth in a steady stream
from the depths of a broken heart. Fourteen of her hymns
were published anonymously the same year (1858) in a
Christian periodical, <i>Budb&auml;raren</i>. Although she lived to
write 650 hymns in all, these fourteen from the pen of the
grief-stricken 26-year-old girl have retained a stronger hold
on the hearts of her countrymen than most of her later
productions. Among these &ldquo;first-fruits&rdquo; born in sorrow are
such hymns as: &ldquo;Saviour, O hide not Thy loving face from
me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Others He hath succored,&rdquo; and</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Children of the heavenly Father</p>
<p class="t0">Safely in His bosom gather;</p>
<p class="t0">Nestling bird nor star in heaven</p>
<p class="t0">Such a refuge e&rsquo;er was given.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The remarkable popularity which Lina Sandell&rsquo;s hymns
attained within a comparatively short time was due to a
large extent to the music written for them by Oskar Ahnfelt,
a &ldquo;spiritual troubadour&rdquo; of his day. Ahnfelt not only
possessed the gift of composing pleasing melodies that caught
the fancy of the Swedish people, but he traveled from place
to place throughout the Scandinavian countries and sang
them to the accompaniment of a guitar. Miss Sandell once
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
said: &ldquo;Ahnfelt has sung my songs into the hearts of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspiration for her songs came to Miss Sandell at
sundry times and places. Sometimes in the midst of the
noise and confusion of the city&rsquo;s streets, she would hear the
words of a new song. Sometimes she would awake in the
still hours of the night with the verses of a hymn ringing
in her ears. By her bedside she always kept a slate on
which she might instantly record these heaven-born thoughts.</p>
<p>In 1867 Miss Sandell was married to a Stockholm merchant,
C. O. Berg, but she continued to sign her hymns
with the initials, &ldquo;L. S.&rdquo; by which she was familiarly known
throughout Sweden. She died on July 27, 1903.</p>
<p>Not only Ahnfelt, but also Jenny Lind helped to make
Lina Sandell&rsquo;s hymns known. The &ldquo;Swedish nightingale&rdquo;
was herself a Pietist and found great delight in listening to
the preaching of Rosenius and the singing of Ahnfelt. At
these conventicles the marvelous singer who had gained the
homage of two continents sat with common workingmen on
crude benches and joined with her sweet voice in singing
the Pietist hymns. Ahnfelt, in visiting the home of the
great singer, spoke of his ambition to publish these hymns.
When Jenny Lind learned that financial difficulties stood
in the way, she quickly provided the necessary funds, and
so the first edition of &ldquo;Ahnfelt&rsquo;s Songs,&rdquo; which in reality
were mostly the hymns of Lina Sandell and Rosenius, was
made possible.</p>
<p>Rosenius and Ahnfelt encountered much persecution in
their evangelical efforts. King Karl XV was petitioned to
forbid Ahnfelt&rsquo;s preaching and singing. The monarch refused
until he had had an opportunity to hear the &ldquo;spiritual
troubadour.&rdquo; Ahnfelt was commanded to appear at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
royal palace. Being considerably perturbed in mind as to
what he should sing to the king, he besought Lina Sandell
to write a hymn for the occasion. She was equal to the
task and within a few days the song was ready. With his
guitar under his arm and the hymn in his pocket, Ahnfelt
repaired to the palace and sang:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Who is it that knocketh upon your heart&rsquo;s door</p>
<p class="t2">In peaceful eve?</p>
<p class="t0">Who is it that brings to the wounded and sore</p>
<p class="t2">The balm that can heal and relieve?</p>
<p class="t0">Your heart is still restless, it findeth no peace</p>
<p class="t2">In earth&rsquo;s pleasures;</p>
<p class="t0">Your soul is still yearning, it seeketh release</p>
<p class="t2">To rise to the heavenly treasures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The king listened with tears in his eyes. When Ahnfelt
had finished, the monarch gripped him by the hand and exclaimed:
&ldquo;You may sing as much as you like in both of
my kingdoms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mention has already been made of the hymns of Rosenius.
These, like the songs of Lina Sandell, were likewise a powerful
factor in the spread of the evangelical movement in
Sweden.</p>
<p>Rosenius was the son of a parish pastor in Norrland,
Sweden. From the time of his birth, February 3, 1816, he
was dedicated by his pious parents to the holy ministry.
After having pursued studies for a short time at Upsala
University, however, he became disgusted with the low moral
and spiritual standards existing among the students, and for
a while his own faith was severely shaken. During these
spiritual difficulties he came in contact with George Scott,
the Methodist evangelist in Stockholm, and eventually he
began to hold meetings as a &ldquo;lay preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>In 1842 Scott and Rosenius began the publication of <i>Pietisten</i>,
a religious monthly that was destined to play a most
important part in the spiritual revival in Sweden. When
Scott was constrained the same year to leave Sweden because
of violent opposition to his movement, Rosenius became his
successor, not only as editor of <i>Pietisten</i>, but also as the
outstanding leader among those who were trying to bring about
the dawn of a new spiritual day.</p>
<p>Rosenius centered his activity in the Swedish capital,
preaching and writing. He also traveled extensively
throughout the country, and so the movement spread. Numerous
lay preachers, known as &ldquo;l&auml;sare,&rdquo; sprang up everywhere,
holding private meetings in homes and in so-called
&ldquo;mission houses&rdquo; that were built nearby the parish churches.</p>
<p>Agitation for separation from the Established Church
found no sympathy with Rosenius, who stood firmly on the
Lutheran doctrine and regularly took communion at the
hands of its ordained ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you intend to remain within the Church?&rdquo;
he once was asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as Jesus is there,&rdquo; was the answer of Rosenius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how long do you think He will be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as men are there born anew, for that is not the
work of the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1856 Rosenius, together with many earnest-minded
ecclesiasts and leaders in the Established Church, organized
the National Evangelical Foundation, which originally was
intended to promote home and inner mission activities. It
subsequently embraced the cause of foreign missions also and
became one of the greatest spiritual influences emanating
from Scandinavia. Rosenius died in 1868, at the age of
fifty-two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>His hymns, like those of Lina Sandell, became known
largely through the musical genius of Ahnfelt. Everywhere
&ldquo;Ahnfelt&rsquo;s Songs&rdquo; were on the lips of the so-called
&ldquo;believers.&rdquo; Emigrants from Sweden to America brought
them with them to the New World, where they were a source
of solace and strength in the midst of spiritual and material
difficulties. Perhaps no song verse was heard more often
in their humble gatherings than the concluding stanza of
Rosenius&rsquo; hymn, &ldquo;With God and His mercy, His Spirit, and
Word&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Shepherd, abide with us, care for us still,</p>
<p class="t0">And feed us and lead us and teach us Thy will;</p>
<p class="t0">And when in Thy heavenly fold we shall be,</p>
<p class="t2">Our thanks and our praises,</p>
<p class="t0">Our thanks and our praises we&rsquo;ll render to Thee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then there is that other hymn by Rosenius, so dear to
thousands of pious souls, &ldquo;I have a Friend, so patient, kind,
forbearing,&rdquo; as well as that other one which Miss Anna
Hoppe has so beautifully rendered into English:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O precious thought! some day the mist shall vanish;</p>
<p class="t">Some day the web of gloom shall be unspun.</p>
<p class="t0">A day shall break whose beams the night shall banish,</p>
<p class="t">For Christ, the Lamb, shall shine, the glorious Sun!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although the songs of Lina Sandell and Rosenius do not
attain to the poetic excellence and spiritual power of the
noble hymns of Wallin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Psalm-book,&rdquo; it is a significant
fact that seven of Lina Sandell&rsquo;s and three of Rosenius&rsquo;
songs were included in an appendix adopted in 1920. This
appendix is the first authorized change in Archbishop Wallin&rsquo;s
masterpiece in 102 years. The 500 hymns of the
&ldquo;Psalm-book&rdquo; still remain unchanged, however, as they came
from his hand in 1819. Although a number of commissions
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
have endeavored since 1865 to make revisions of Wallin&rsquo;s
work, their proposals have been consistently rejected. The
addition of 173 hymns in the form of an appendix was a
compromise adopted by the Church of Sweden in 1920. It
was sanctioned by the king and authorized for tentative use
in the churches beginning Nov. 27, 1921, thus being given
precedence over a revision made by a commission and sanctioned
by the church but indefinitely deferred.</p>
<p>In the 1921 appendix hymn-writers of the Reformed
Church are represented for the first time in the Swedish
&ldquo;Psalm-book.&rdquo; Among the Reformed hymns found there
may be mentioned Joachim Neander&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lobe den Herren,&rdquo;
Sarah Flower Adams&rsquo; &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,&rdquo; Henry
Francis Lyte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abide with me, fast falls the eventide,&rdquo; John
Marriot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thou, Whose almighty Word,&rdquo; and Lydia Baxter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;There is a gate that stands ajar.&rdquo; Classical Lutheran
hymns, such as Gerhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;O sacred Head, now wounded&rdquo;
and Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word,&rdquo; have
also been added, while other Lutheran writers, such as the
great Danish hymnists, Brorson and Grundtvig, and the
Norwegian psalmist, Landstad, are given recognition. Then
there is the beautiful Christmas hymn, &ldquo;Silent night, holy
night,&rdquo; by the Catholic priest, Joseph Mohr.</p>
<p>The more important of recent Swedish hymnists are Johan
Alfred Eklund, bishop of Karlstad, who is represented by
thirty-six hymns in the appendix; Svante Alin, pastor at
Sventorp, eleven of whose hymns are included; the late Edvard
Evers, pastor in Norrk&ouml;ping and a writer of some note,
who contributed twelve hymns, and Erik S&ouml;derberg, writer
and publicist, who is the author of seven.</p>
<p>Eleven hymns by two of Finland&rsquo;s great poets, Johan
Ludvig Runeberg and Zachris Topelius, are also found in
the appendix.</p>

<h3>KINGO, THE POET OF EASTER-TIDE</h3>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s first great hymnist, Thomas Kingo, hailed from the land of Robert Burns. His
grandfather, who also bore the name of Thomas, emigrated from Scotland to Denmark near the
end of the 17th century to become a tapestry weaver for Christian IV.</p>
<p>The boy who was destined to become one of Denmark&rsquo;s most famous spiritual bards was born
in Slangerup, December 15, 1634. At the age of six years he entered the Latin school of his
native city, and ten years later became a student of the school in Frederiksborg. The principal
of this institution, Albert Bartholin, discovered unusual gifts in the lad and took him into his
own home. After completing theological studies at the university, he returned in 1668 to his
native city of Slangerup as Lutheran parish pastor.</p>
<p>About this time he began to attract attention as a writer of secular poetry. It was not until
1673, however, that his first collection of hymns appeared under the title, &ldquo;Spiritual Songs, First
Part.&rdquo; The profound impression created by this production is evidenced by the fact that in 1677
he was elevated from an obscure parish to the bishopric of the diocese of Fyen.</p>
<p>Kingo had dedicated his &ldquo;Spiritual Songs&rdquo; to Christian V, and thus had attracted the attention
of the Danish monarch. In his &ldquo;address&rdquo; to the king, Kingo deplored the fact that the Danish
people in their worship had depended so largely upon hymns of foreign origin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The soul of the Danes,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;is not so bound and impoverished but that it
can soar as high toward heaven as that of other peoples, even if it be not upborne by strange
and foreign wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Second Part of his &ldquo;Spiritual Songs&rdquo; appeared in 1681, this collection being dedicated
to the Danish queen. Many of Kingo&rsquo;s hymns were written to be sung to popular folk melodies. In
justification of this practice the poet wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a pleasing melody set to a song of Sodom delights your ear, how much more, if you are a
true child of God, should not that same melody delight your soul when sung to a song of Zion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his dedicatory address to Queen Charlotte, the poet of Scotch forebears gave expression to
his great love for the Danish language, praised her for her heroic efforts to master the language
before coming to Denmark as its queen, and ironically flayed certain foreign courtiers who for
&ldquo;thirty years had eaten the bread of the Fatherland in the service of the king without making an
effort to learn thirty Danish words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Danish people had come to a full realization that a poet of the first magnitude
had risen in their midst. In June, 1679, Kingo was created a member of the nobility, and in 1682
he received the honorary degree of doctor of theology. The following year came the royal
appointment to prepare a hymn-book for the Church of Denmark. The king&rsquo;s decree
specifically stated that Kingo should include a number of his own hymns, but he was directed
to make few changes in the old, traditional hymns, and &ldquo;under no circumstances to alter the
meaning of Luther&rsquo;s hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>The first part of Kingo&rsquo;s new book appeared in 1689. It met with a storm of disapproval that
was not altogether unmerited. Of the 267 hymns in this book, 136 were by Kingo himself.
Members of the Danish court who had been objects of Kingo&rsquo;s merciless satire now found an
opportunity to secure revenge. Kingo&rsquo;s book, which had been published at his own expense,
was rejected, and Soren Jonassen, dean of Roskilde, was appointed to take over the task. His
work, which was completed in 1693, did not contain a single one of Kingo&rsquo;s hymns! It too was
promptly disapproved. A commission was then appointed by the king to supervise the work,
and again Kingo came into favor. The new hymn-book, which was officially approved in 1699,
was based largely on Kingo&rsquo;s work, and contained 85 of his original hymns.</p>
<p>Although Kingo lived to see his life-work crowned with success, he never recovered from the
indignity and humiliation he had suffered. His death occurred on October 14, 1703. The day
before his death, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Tomorrow, Lord, we shall hear glorious music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingo has been called &ldquo;the poet of Easter-tide.&rdquo; A biographer declares that Kingo was &ldquo;in love
with the sun,&rdquo; and that he regarded light as the &ldquo;true element.&rdquo; This is reflected in his morning
hymns, which are among the finest songs of praise ever written. It may also be seen in his
Easter hymns, one of which begins with the words, &ldquo;Like the golden sun ascending.&rdquo;
However, Kingo could also dwell on the theme of Christ&rsquo;s passion with gripping pathos:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Such a night was ne&rsquo;er before,</p>
<p class="t0">Even heaven has shut its door;</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, Thou our Sun and Light,</p>
<p class="t0">Now must bear the shame of night.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And in this:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See how, in that hour of darkness,</p>
<p class="t">Battling with the evil power,</p>
<p class="t0">Agonies untold assail Him,</p>
<p class="t">On His soul the arrows shower;</p>
<p class="t0">And the gardens flowers are wet</p>
<p class="t0">With the drops of bloody sweat</p>
<p class="t0">From His anguished frame distilling&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Our redemption thus fulfilling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the commission appointed by the Danish king was revising his hymn-book, Kingo
pleaded that his Lenten hymns might be retained. Among the most soul-stirring of these in the
famous hymn, &ldquo;Over Kedron Jesus treadeth.&rdquo; In its original form it contained fourteen stanzas.
Although objective in character, Kingo&rsquo;s hymns never fail to make a strong personal appeal.
Witness, for example, the following from his Good Friday hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">On my heart imprint Thine image,</p>
<p class="t">Blessed Jesus, King of grace,</p>
<p class="t0">That life&rsquo;s riches, cares, and pleasures</p>
<p class="t">Never may Thyself efface;</p>
<p class="t0">This the superscription be:</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, crucified for me,</p>
<p class="t0">Is my life, my hope&rsquo;s foundation,</p>
<p class="t0">And my glory and salvation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other hymns of Kingo that have been translated into English include &ldquo;Praise to Thee and
adoration,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dearest Jesus, draw Thou near me,&rdquo; &ldquo;He that believes and is baptized,&rdquo; &ldquo;O dearest
Lord, receive from me,&rdquo; &ldquo;I come, invited
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
by Thy Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;Softly now the day is ending,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The sun arises now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig, a later Danish hymn-writer, pays Kingo this tribute: &ldquo;He effected a combination of
sublimity and simplicity, a union of splendor and fervent devotion, a powerful and musical
play of words and imagery that reminds one of Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c30" title="Brorson, the Poet of Christmas">
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h3>BRORSON, THE POET OF CHRISTMAS</h3>
<p>No Scandinavian hymn has attained such popularity in recent years as &ldquo;Behold a host.&rdquo; This
sublime &ldquo;glory song&rdquo; was first given to the world after its writer, Hans Adolph Brorson, had
gone to join the &ldquo;host, arrayed in white&rdquo; that sings &ldquo;before the throne of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was published by his son in a collection entitled &ldquo;Hans Adolph Brorson&rsquo;s Swan-Song,&rdquo; which
appeared in 1765, a year after the famous Danish hymn-writer had gone to his final rest. The
collection contained seventy hymns, all written in the last year of the poet&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Brorson was a product of the Pietistic movement emanating from Halle, in Germany. Born June
20, 1694, at Randrup, Denmark, he early came under the influence of the great spiritual
awakening which was then sweeping through the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>Brorson&rsquo;s father was a Lutheran pastor, and all of his three sons, including the hymn-writer,
entered the service of the Church. Brorson&rsquo;s first pastorate was in his native city of Randrup, a
place he dearly loved and to which he often returned in later life when he found himself
oppressed by manifold cares.</p>
<p>It was during his ministry in Randrup that Brorson began to write his first hymns. He speaks of
the eight years spent at this place as the happiest in his life. In 1729 he was called to become
Danish preacher at Tonder, where he labored side by side with Johan Herman Schrader, who was
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
also a hymnist of some note. Because of the mixed Danish and German population of
Tonder, a curious situation existed in the church worship. Although Brorson preached in
Danish, the congregation sang in German! To remedy this, Brorson, in 1732, wrote a number of
his famous Christmas hymns, among them &lsquo;Den yndigste Rose er funden,&rsquo; one of the most
exquisite gems in sacred poetry. A free rendering of four of its eleven stanzas by August W.
Kjellstrand follows:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sweetest, the fairest of roses</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ve found. Among thorns it reposes:</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis Jesus, my soul&rsquo;s dearest Treasure,</p>
<p class="t0">Of sinners a Friend above measure.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">E&rsquo;er since the sad day when frail mortals</p>
<p class="t0">Were thrust from fair Eden&rsquo;s bright portals,</p>
<p class="t0">The world has been dark, full of terror,</p>
<p class="t0">And man dead in sin, lost in error.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then mindful of promises given,</p>
<p class="t0">God sent from the gardens of heaven</p>
<p class="t0">A Rose, &rsquo;mid the thorns brightly blowing,</p>
<p class="t0">And freely its fragrance bestowing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wherever this Rose Tree is grounded,</p>
<p class="t0">The kingdom of God there is founded;</p>
<p class="t0">And where its sweet fragrance is wafted,</p>
<p class="t0">There peace in the heart is engrafted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As Kingo was known among the Danes as &ldquo;the poet of Easter,&rdquo; so Brorson from this time was
hailed as &ldquo;the poet of Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1747 Brorson was appointed by Christian VI to become bishop of the diocese of Ribe. It is
said that the Danish monarch upon meeting Brorson at a certain occasion inquired of him if he
was the author of the hymn, &ldquo;Awake, all things that God has made.&rdquo; When the poet modestly
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
answered in the affirmative, so the story runs, the king promised him the bishopric.
When Erik Pontoppidan, later bishop of Bergen, was appointed to revise Kingo&rsquo;s hymnal,
which for forty years had served the churches of Denmark and Norway, he found his task a
comparatively simple one through the valuable assistance rendered by Brorson. Kingo&rsquo;s hymns
were changed only slightly, and the greater part of the new material was from Brorson&rsquo;s pen.</p>
<p>The later years of the poet were darkened by sad experiences. In the year that Brorson was
elevated to the bishopric, his beloved wife died while giving birth to their thirteenth child.
This and other troubles served to make him melancholy in spirit, but he did not cease to compose
poems of rarest beauty. His thoughts, however, turned more and more toward heaven and the
blessedness of the life hereafter. A celestial radiance is reflected in the hymns of his
&ldquo;Swan-Song.&rdquo; This is particularly true of &ldquo;Behold, a host arrayed in white,&rdquo; a lyric that has
become a favorite in America as well as in Europe through its association with Edvard Grieg&rsquo;s
famous adaptation of a Norwegian folk song.</p>
<p>Brorson&rsquo;s earnest character and pious nature made him deeply concerned about the salvation
of souls. Many of his poems and hymns contain solemn warnings touching on the uncertainty
of life and the need of seeking salvation. His gripping hymn, &ldquo;Jeg gaar i Fare, hvor jeg gaar,&rdquo;
gave Archbishop Wallin, the great Swedish hymnist, the inspiration for his noble stanzas:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I near the grave, where&rsquo;er I go,</p>
<p class="t">Where&rsquo;er my pathway tendeth;</p>
<p class="t0">If rough or pleasant here below,</p>
<p class="t">My way at death&rsquo;s gate endeth.</p>
<p class="t2">I have no other choice;</p>
<p class="t2">Between my griefs and joys</p>
<p class="t0">My mortal life is ordered so:</p>
<p class="t0">I near the grave, where&rsquo;er I go.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I go to heaven, where&rsquo;er I go,</p>
<p class="t">If Jesus&rsquo; steps I follow;</p>
<p class="t0">The crown of life He will bestow,</p>
<p class="t">When earth this frame shall swallow.</p>
<p class="t2">If through this tearful vale</p>
<p class="t2">I in that course prevail,</p>
<p class="t0">And walk with Jesus here below,</p>
<p class="t0">I go to heaven, where&rsquo;er I go.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other well-known hymns by Brorson are &ldquo;Thy little ones, dear Lord, are we,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Father, may
Thy Word prevail,&rdquo; &ldquo;O watch and pray,&rdquo; &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s day is ended,&rdquo; &ldquo;My heart, prepare to give
account,&rdquo; &ldquo;By faith we are divinely sure,&rdquo; &ldquo;Children of God, born again of His Spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;O seek
the Lord today,&rdquo; &ldquo;I see Thee standing, Lamb of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand fast, my soul, stand fast,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus,
Name of wondrous grace,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who will join the throng to heaven?&rdquo; Brorson&rsquo;s childlike spirit
may be seen reflected in the first of these, a children&rsquo;s Christmas hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy little ones, dear Lord, are we,</p>
<p class="t0">And come Thy lowly bed to see;</p>

</div>
<div id="c31" title="Grundtvig, the Poet of Whitsuntide">
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h3>GRUNDTVIG, THE POET OF WHITSUNTIDE</h3>
<p>Nikolai F. S. Grundtvig was the last and greatest of the celebrated triumvirate of Danish
hymn-writers. As Kingo was the bright star of the 17th century and Brorson of the 18th
century, so Grundtvig shone with a luster all his own in the 19th century. The &ldquo;poet of Easter&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;poet of Christmas&rdquo; were succeeded by the &ldquo;poet of Whitsuntide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appellation given to Grundtvig was not without reason, for it was he, above all others,
who strove mightily in Denmark against the deadening spirit of rationalism which had dried
up the streams of spirituality in the Church. No one as he labored with such amazing courage
and zeal to bring about the dawn of a new day.</p>
<p>Nor did Grundtvig strive in vain. Before his life-work was ended, fresh Pentecostal breezes
began to blow, the dry bones began to stir, and the Church, moved by the Spirit of God,
experienced a new spiritual birth.</p>
<p>The spirit of rationalism had worked havoc with the most sacred truths of the Christian
religion. As some one has said, &ldquo;It converted the banner of the Lamb into a blue-striped
handkerchief, the Christian religion into a philosophy of happiness, and the temple dome into
a parasol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the influence of the &ldquo;new theology,&rdquo; ministers of the gospel had prostituted the church
worship into lectures on science and domestic economy. It is said that one minister
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
in preaching on the theme of the Christ-child and the manger developed it into a lecture on the
proper care of stables, and another, moved by the story of the coming of the holy women to the
sepulcher on the first Easter morning, delivered a peroration on the advantages of getting up
early! God was referred to as &ldquo;Providence&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Deity,&rdquo; Christ as &ldquo;the founder of
Christianity,&rdquo; sin as &ldquo;error,&rdquo; salvation as &ldquo;happiness,&rdquo; and the essence of the Christian life as
&ldquo;morality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s father was one of the few Lutheran pastors in Denmark who had remained faithful
to evangelical truth. The future poet, who was born in Udby, September 8, 1783, had the
advantage, therefore, of being brought up in a household where the spirit of true Christian
piety reigned. It was not long, however, before young Grundtvig, as a student, came under the
influence of the &ldquo;new theology.&rdquo; Although he planned to become a minister, he lost all interest
in religion during his final year at school, and finished his academic career &ldquo;without spirit and
without faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of circumstances, however, began to open his eyes to the spiritual poverty of the
people. Morality was at a low ebb, and a spirit of indifference and frivolity banished all serious
thoughts from their minds. It was a rude shock to his sensitive and patriotic nature to observe,
in 1807, how the population of Copenhagen laughed and danced while the Danish fleet was
being destroyed by English warships and the capital city itself was being bombarded by the
enemy.</p>
<p>In 1810 he preached his famous probation sermon on the striking theme, &ldquo;Why has the Word of
God departed from His house?&rdquo; The sermon produced a sensation, and from this time
Grundtvig came to be known as a mystic and fanatic.
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
His career as a pastor was checkered, but
throughout his life he exerted a powerful influence by his literary activity as well as by his
preaching. His poetry and hymns attracted so much attention that it was said that &ldquo;Kingo&rsquo;s
harp has been strung afresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundtvig&rsquo;s strongest hymns are those that deal with the Church and the sacraments. The
divine character of the Church is continually stressed, for Christ not only founded it, but, as the
Living Word, He is present in it and in the sacraments unto the end of time. &ldquo;Built on the Rock,
the Church doth stand&rdquo; is probably his most famous hymn. Grundtvig was more concerned
about the thought he was trying to convey than the mode of expression; therefore his hymns
are often characterized by strength rather than poetic beauty. They are also so deeply tinged by
national spirit and feeling that they lose much of the color and fragrance of their native heath
when translated. That Grundtvig could rise to lyrical heights is revealed especially in his festival
hymns. There is a charming freshness in the sweet Christmas hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Chime, happy Christmas bells, once more!</p>
<p class="t0">The heavenly Guest is at the door,</p>
<p class="t0">The blessed words the shepherds thrill,</p>
<p class="t0">The joyous tidings, &ldquo;Peace, good will.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let us go with quiet mind,</p>
<p class="t0">The gentle Babe with shepherds find,</p>
<p class="t0">To gaze on Him who gladdens them,</p>
<p class="t0">The loveliest flower of Jesse&rsquo;s stem.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Jesus, glorious heavenly Guest,</p>
<p class="t0">Keep Thine own Christmas in our breast,</p>
<p class="t0">Then David&rsquo;s harp-strings, hushed so long,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall swell our jubilee of song.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>The Danish hymnologist Brandt has pointed out the distinctive characteristics of his country&rsquo;s
three great hymnists by calling attention to their favorite symbols. That of Kingo was the sun,
Brorson&rsquo;s the rose, and Grundtvig&rsquo;s the bird. Kingo extols Christ as the risen, victorious
Saviour&mdash;the Sun that breaks through the dark shades of sin and death. Brorson glorifies Christ
as the Friend of the spiritually poor and needy. They learn to know Him in the secret prayer
chamber as the Rose that spreads its quiet fragrance. Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymns are primarily hymns
of the Spirit. They laud the Holy Spirit, the Giver and Renewer of life, who bears us up on
mighty wings toward the mansions of light.</p>
<p>Among Danes and Norwegians there are few hymns more popular than Grundtvig&rsquo;s hymn on
the Church. The first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Built on the Rock the Church doth stand,</p>
<p class="t">Even when steeples are falling;</p>
<p class="t0">Crumbled have spires in every land,</p>
<p class="t">Bells still are chiming and calling;</p>
<p class="t0">Calling the young and old to rest,</p>
<p class="t0">But above all the soul distressed,</p>
<p class="t">Longing for rest everlasting.</p>

<p>Other noted hymns by Grundtvig include &ldquo;Love, the fount of light from heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;As the rose
shall blossom here,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord to thee appealeth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Splendid are the heavens high,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Babe is
born in Bethlehem,&rdquo; &ldquo;From the grave remove dark crosses,&rdquo; &ldquo;O let Thy Spirit with us tarry,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fair beyond telling,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the day that our Father hath given,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hast to the plow thou put
thy hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;The peace of God protects our hearts,&rdquo; &ldquo;O wondrous kingdom here on earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;With
gladness we hail this blessed day,&rdquo; &ldquo;He who
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
has helped me hitherto,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peace to soothe our bitter woes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of his intensive efforts to bring about reforms in the educational methods of his day,
Grundtvig became known as &ldquo;the father of the public high school in Scandinavia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1861, when he celebrated his golden jubilee as pastor, Grundtvig was given the title of
bishop. The good old man passed away peacefully on September 2, 1872, at the age of
eighty-nine years. He preached his last sermon on the day before his death.</p>
<p>A distinguished contemporary of Grundtvig&rsquo;s who also
gained renown as a Danish hymn-writer was Bernhardt
Severin Ingemann, author of the famous hymn, &ldquo;Through
the night of doubt and sorrow.&rdquo; Ingemann was born in
Falster, Denmark, in 1789, the son of a Lutheran pastor,
Soren Ingemann.</p>
<p>The father died when Bernhardt was 11 years old, but
the mother made it possible for the gifted lad to receive a
liberal education. At the age of 22 years he published his
first volume of poems, and three years later his famous epic,
&ldquo;The Black Knights,&rdquo; appeared. A number of dramas followed,
and in 1822 he was appointed lector of Danish language
and literature at the Academy of Soro. Here he remained
for forty years, writing novels, secular poetry and
hymns. He was a warm friend of Grundtvig&rsquo;s, who constantly
encouraged him in his literary efforts.</p>
<p>Ingemann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Hymns&rdquo; appeared in 1822, and in
1825 his &ldquo;Hymns of Worship&rdquo; was published. In 1854 he
was charged with the task of completing the &ldquo;Psalm Book
for Church and Private Devotion,&rdquo; edited by the ministerial
conference at Roskilde.</p>

<div id="c32" title="Landstad, a Bard of the Frozen Fjords">
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h3>LANDSTAD, A BARD OF THE FROZEN FJORDS</h3>
<p>This is the story of a man whose chance purchase of
two books at an auction sale for the sum of four
cents was probably the means of inspiring him to
become one of the foremost Christian poets of the North.</p>
<p>Magnus Brorstrup Landstad was a poverty-stricken student
at the University of Christiania (now Oslo), Norway,
when he happened to pass a house in which a sale of books
was being conducted. Moved by curiosity, he entered the
place just as a package of old books was being offered. We
will let him tell the remainder of the story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a bid of four cents, the deal was made, and I
walked home with my package. It contained two volumes
in leather binding. One was &lsquo;Freuden-Spiegel des ewigen
Lebens&rsquo; by Philipp Nicolai. On the last few pages of this
book four of Nicolai&rsquo;s hymns were printed. The other book
was Bishop A. Arrebo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hexaemeron, The Glorious and
Mighty Works of the Creation Day.&rsquo; In this manner two
splendid hymn collections, one German and the other
Danish-Norwegian, unexpectedly came into my possession. I
was not acquainted with either of these works before. Nicolai&rsquo;s
hymns made a deep impression on me, and I at once
attempted to translate them.... My experience with these
hymn collections, I believe, gave me the first impetus in the
direction of hymn writing. Furthermore, it gave me a
deeper insight into the life and spirit of the old church
hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the hymns of Nicolai that Landstad attempted
to translate were &ldquo;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme&rdquo; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
&ldquo;Wie sch&ouml;n leuchtet der Morgenstern,&rdquo; noble classics that
have never been excelled. The young student was so
successful in his rendering of the former hymn that it
subsequently found a place in the Norwegian church hymnary.</p>
<p>Landstad was born October 7, 1802, in Maaso, Finnmarken,
Norway, where his father was pastor of the Lutheran
church. This parish is at the extreme northern point of
Norway, and so Landstad himself wrote, &ldquo;I was baptized
in the northernmost church in the world.&rdquo; Later the family
moved to Oksnes, another parish among the frozen fjords
of the Norse seacoast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The waves of the icy Arctic,&rdquo; he writes poetically, &ldquo;sang
my cradle lullaby; but the bosom of a loving mother warmed
my body and soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stern character of the relentless North, with its solitude,
its frozen wastes, its stormy waters and its long
months of winter darkness, no doubt left a profound and
lasting impression upon the lad whose early years were spent
in such environments. The Napoleonic wars were also raging,
and it was a time of much sorrow and suffering among
the common people. When the boy was nine years old the
family removed to Vinje. Although they continued to suffer
many hardships, the natural surroundings at this place were
more congenial, and in summer the landscape was transformed
into a magic beauty that must have warmed the heart
and fired the childish imagination of the future hymnist.</p>
<p>Magnus was the third in a family of ten children. Although
sorely pressed by poverty, the father recognized unusual
talent in the boy, and at the age of twenty years he
was sent to the university in Christiania. During his first
year at the institution two of his brothers died. Young
Landstad was greatly cast down in spirit, but out of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
bitterness of this early bereavement came two memorial
poems that are believed to represent his first attempt at
verse-writing.</p>
<p>In 1827 he completed his theological studies at the university
and the following year he was appointed resident vicar
of the Lutheran church at Gausdal. During his pastorate
at this place he wrote his first hymn. In 1834 he became
pastor at Kviteseid, where he continued the writing of hymns
and other poems. Five years later he became his father&rsquo;s
successor as pastor of the parish at Seljord. It was here,
in 1841, that he published his first work, a book of daily
devotions that has been highly prized among his countrymen.</p>
<p>For centuries Norway and Denmark had been closely connected
politically and culturally. The Lutheran Church
was, moreover, the state church of both countries. As a
consequence of this relationship Norway had always looked to
Denmark for its hymn literature, and no hymnist of any
note had ever risen in the northern country.</p>
<p>Now, however, it began to dawn on the Norwegians that
a native singer dwelt in their own midst. The political ties
with Denmark having been broken as a result of the Napoleonic
wars, the spirit of nationalism began to assert itself
and the demand for a new hymn-book for the Church of
Norway constantly grew stronger. In 1848 the Norwegian
ecclesiastical authorities requested Landstad to undertake
the task, but not until four years later could he be prevailed
upon to assume the arduous duties involved in so great an
endeavor.</p>
<p>In 1861 the first draft of his &ldquo;Kirke-Salmebog&rdquo; was published.
It did not meet with universal approval. In defense
of his work, Landstad wrote: &ldquo;We must, above all,
demand that our hymns possess the elements of poetic diction
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
and true song. We must consider the historical and churchly
elements, and the orthodox objectivity which shows respect
for church tradition and which appreciates the purity, clearness,
and force of confession. But the sickly subjectivity,
which &lsquo;rests&rsquo; in the varying moods of pious feelings and
godly longings, and yet does not possess any of the boldness
and power of true faith such as we find in Luther&rsquo;s and
Kingo&rsquo;s hymns&mdash;this type of church hymn must be excluded.
Finally, we must also emphasize the aesthetic feature. Art
must be made to serve the Church, to glorify the name of
God, and to edify the congregation of worshipers. But it
must always be remembered that art itself is to be the
servant and not the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Landstad continued for several years to revise
his own work, and in 1869 the hymn-book was finally
published and authorized for use in the Church of Norway.
Within a year it had been introduced into 648 of the 923
parishes of the country.</p>
<p>In 1876 Landstad retired from active service after the
Norwegian parliament had unanimously voted him an annual
pension of 4,000 crowns in appreciation of the great
service he had rendered his country. He died in Christiania,
October 9, 1880.</p>
<p>Among the hymns of Landstad that have been translated
into English are, &ldquo;I know of a sleep in Jesus&rsquo; Name,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
come to Thee, O blessed Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;There many shall come
from the East and the West,&rdquo; &ldquo;When sinners see their lost
condition,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Before Thee, God, who knowest all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Landstad&rsquo;s hymns do not attain to lofty poetic
heights, they are marked by a spirit of unusual intimacy,
deep earnestness, and a warmth of feeling that make a strong
appeal to the worshiper.</p>

<div id="c33" title="The Dawn of Hymnody in England">
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h3>THE DAWN OF HYMNODY IN ENGLAND</h3>
<p>Owing to the strong prejudice in the Reformed
Church to hymns of &ldquo;human composure,&rdquo; the development
of hymnody in England, as well as other
countries where Calvin&rsquo;s teachings were accepted, was slow.
Crude paraphrases of the Psalms, based on the Genevan
Psalter, appeared from the hands of various versifiers and
were used generally in the churches of England and Scotland.
It was not until 1637, more than a century after Luther
had published his first hymn-books, that England&rsquo;s first
hymn-writer was born. He was Bishop Thomas Ken.</p>
<p>This first sweet singer in the early dawn of English
hymnody holds the distinction of having written the most
famous doxology of the Christian Church. It is the so-called
&ldquo;long meter&rdquo; doxology:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him, all creatures here below;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>His sublime evening hymn, &ldquo;Glory to Thee, my God, this
night,&rdquo; is ranked as one of the four masterpieces of English
praise. His beautiful morning hymn, &ldquo;Awake, my soul, and
with the sun,&rdquo; is scarcely less deserving of high distinction.
As originally written, both hymns closed with the famous
doxology given above.</p>
<p>Bishop Ken looms as a heroic figure during turbulent
times in English history. Left an orphan in early childhood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
he was brought up by his brother-in-law, the famous
fisherman, Izaak Walton. Ken&rsquo;s name has been found cut
in one of the stone pillars at Winchester, where he went
to school as a boy.</p>
<p>When, in 1679, the wife of William of Orange, the niece
of the English monarch, asked Charles II, king of England,
to send an English chaplain to the royal court at The Hague,
Ken was selected for the position. However, he was so outspoken
in denouncing the corrupt lives of those in authority
in the Dutch capitol that he was compelled to leave the following
year. Charles thereupon appointed him one of his
own chaplains.</p>
<p>Ken continued to reveal the same spirit of boldness, however,
rebuking the sins of the dissolute English monarch.
On one occasion, when Charles asked the courageous pastor
to give up his own dwelling temporarily in order that Nell
Gwynne, a notorious character, might be housed, Ken answered
promptly: &ldquo;Not for the King&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of punishing the bold and faithful minister,
Charles so admired his courage that he appointed him bishop
of Bath and Wells.</p>
<p>Charles always referred to Ken as &ldquo;the good little man&rdquo;
and, when it was chapel time, he would usually say: &ldquo;I
must go in and hear Ken tell me of my faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Charles died, and the papist James II came to the
throne, Ken, together with six other bishops, was imprisoned
in the Tower of London. Although he was acquitted, he
was later removed from his bishopric by William III.</p>
<p>The last years of his life were spent in a quiet retreat,
and he died in 1711 at the age of seventy-four years. He
had requested that &ldquo;six of the poorest men in the parish&rdquo;
should carry him to his grave, and this was done. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
also at his request that he was buried under the east window
of the chancel of Frome church, the service being held at
sunrise. As his body was lowered into its last resting-place,
and the first light of dawn came through the chancel window,
his friends sang his immortal morning hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Awake, my soul, and with the sun</p>
<p class="t0">Thy daily stage of duty run.</p>
<p class="t0">Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise</p>
<p class="t0">To pay thy morning sacrifice.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wake and lift up thyself, my heart,</p>
<p class="t0">And with the angels bear thy part,</p>
<p class="t0">Who all night long unwearied sing</p>
<p class="t0">High praise to the eternal King.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All praise to Thee, who safe hast kept,</p>
<p class="t0">And hast refreshed me while I slept:</p>
<p class="t0">Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake,</p>
<p class="t0">I may of endless life partake.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is said that after Bishop Ken had written this hymn,
he sang it to his own accompaniment on the lute every morning
as a part of his private devotion. Although he wrote
many other hymns, only this one and his evening hymn have
survived. The two hymns were published in a devotional
book prepared for the students of Winchester College. In
this work Bishop Ken urged the students to sing the hymns
devoutly in their rooms every morning and evening.</p>
<p>The historian Macaulay paid Ken a beautiful tribute
when he said that he came as near to the ideal of Christian
perfection &ldquo;as human weakness permits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during the life-time of Bishop Ken that Joseph
Addison, the famous essayist, was publishing the &ldquo;Spectator.&rdquo;
Addison was not only the leading literary light of his time,
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
but a devout Christian as well. From time to time he appended
a poem to the charming essays which appeared in
the &ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; and it is from this source that we have
received five hymns of rare beauty. They are the so-called
&ldquo;Creation&rdquo; hymn, &ldquo;The spacious firmament on high,&rdquo; which
Haydn included in his celebrated oratorio; the Traveler&rsquo;s
hymn, beginning with the line, &ldquo;How are Thy servants
blest, O Lord&rdquo;; and three other hymns, almost equally well-known:
&ldquo;The Lord my pasture shall prepare,&rdquo; &ldquo;When
rising from the bed of death,&rdquo; and &ldquo;When all Thy mercies,
O my God.&rdquo; The latter contains one of the most striking
expressions in all the realm of hymnody:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through all eternity to Thee</p>
<p class="t">A joyful song I&rsquo;ll raise:</p>
<p class="t0">But oh, eternity&rsquo;s too short</p>
<p class="t">To utter all Thy praise!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the essay introducing this hymn, Addison writes: &ldquo;If
gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from
man to his Maker. The Supreme Being does not only confer
upon us those bounties which proceed immediately from
His hand, but even those benefits which are conveyed to us
by others. Any blessing which we enjoy, by what means
soever derived, is the gift of Him who is the great Author
of Good and the Father of Mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Traveler&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;How are Thy servants blessed,
O Lord,&rdquo; was written after Addison&rsquo;s return from a perilous
voyage on the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In addition to his literary pursuits, Addison also occupied
several important positions of state with the English
government. He died on June 17, 1719, at the age of forty-seven.
When he was breathing his last, he called for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Earl of Warwick and exclaimed: &ldquo;See in what peace a
Christian can die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymns of Addison and Bishop Ken may be regarded
as the heralds of a new day in the worship of the Reformed
Church. While Addison was still writing his essays and verses
for the &ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; Isaac Watts, peer of all
English hymnists, was already tuning his lyre of many strings.
Psalmody was beginning to yield to hymnody.</p>

<div id="c34" title="Isaac Watts, Father of English Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h3>ISAAC WATTS, FATHER OF ENGLISH HYMNODY</h3>
<p>By universal consent the title, &ldquo;Father of English
Hymnody,&rdquo; is bestowed upon Isaac Watts. English
hymns had been written before the time of Watts,
notably the beautiful classics of Ken and Addison; but it
remained for the genius of Watts to break the iron rule of
psalmody in the Reformed Church which had continued
uninterrupted since the days of Calvin.</p>
<p>Watts was born in Southampton, England, July 17, 1674.
His father was a &ldquo;dissenter,&rdquo; and twice was imprisoned for
his religious views. This was during the time when Isaac
was still a baby, and the mother often carried the future
poet in her arms when she went to visit her husband in
prison.</p>
<p>When Isaac grew up, a wealthy man offered to give him
a university education if he would consent to become a minister
in the Established Church. This he refused to do, but
prepared instead for the Independent ministry.</p>
<p>Early in life young Watts had revealed signs of poetic
genius. As a boy of seven years he had amused his parents
with his rhymes. As he grew older he became impatient
with the wretched paraphrases of the Psalms then in use in
the Reformed churches. These views were shared generally
by those who possessed a discriminating taste in poetry.
&ldquo;Scandalous doggerel&rdquo; was the term applied by Samuel
Wesley, father of the famous Wesley brothers, to the versified
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Psalms of Sternhold and Hopkins, who had published
the most popular psalm-book of the day.</p>
<p>When young Watts ventured to voice his displeasure over
the psalm-singing in his father&rsquo;s church in Southampton, one
of the church officers retorted: &ldquo;Give us something better,
young man.&rdquo; Although he was only eighteen years old
at the time, he accepted the challenge and wrote his first
hymn, which was sung at the following Sunday evening
services. The first stanza seems prophetic of his future career:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Behold the glories of the Lamb</p>
<p class="t">Amidst His Father&rsquo;s throne;</p>
<p class="t0">Prepare new honors for His Name,</p>
<p class="t">And songs before unknown.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hymn met with such favorable reception that the
youthful poet was encouraged to write others, and within
the next two years he produced nearly all of the 210 hymns
that constituted his famous collection, &ldquo;Hymns and Spiritual
Songs,&rdquo; published in 1707. This was the first real
hymn-book in the English language.</p>
<p>Twelve years later he published his &ldquo;Psalms of David,&rdquo;
a metrical version of the Psalter, but, as he himself stated,
rendered &ldquo;in the language of the New Testament, and applied
to the Christian state and worship.&rdquo; Indeed, the
Psalms were given such a distinctively Christian flavor that
their Old Testament origin is often overlooked. Witness,
for example, the opening lines of his rendition of the
Seventy-second Psalm:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus shall reign where&rsquo;er the sun</p>
<p class="t0">Does his successive journeys run.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>In addition to being a preacher and a poet, Watts was
an ardent student of theology and philosophy, and wrote several
notable books. Always frail in health from childhood,
his intense studies finally resulted in completely shattering
his constitution, and he was compelled to give up his parish.</p>
<p>During this period of physical distress, the stricken poet
was invited to become a guest for a week in the home of Sir
Thomas Abney, an intimate friend and admirer. The
friendship continued to grow, and inasmuch as Watts did
not improve in health, he was urged to remain. He finally
so endeared himself to the Abney family that they refused
to let him go, and he who had come to spend a week remained
for the rest of his life&mdash;thirty-six years!</p>
<p>The great hymnist died on November 25, 1748, and was
buried at Bunhill Fields, London, near the graves of John
Bunyan and Daniel Defoe. A monument to his memory
was placed in Westminster Abbey, the highest honor that
can be bestowed upon an Englishman.</p>
<p>To Isaac Watts we are indebted for some of our most
sublime hymns. &ldquo;When I survey the wondrous cross&rdquo; has
been named by Matthew Arnold as the finest hymn in the
English language, and most critics concur in the judgment.
Certainly it is one of the most beautiful. John Julian,
the noted hymnologist, declares that it must be classified
with the four hymns that stand at the head of all English
hymns.</p>
<p>Other hymns of Watts continue to hold their grip on the
Christian Church after the passing of two centuries. No
Christmas service seems complete without singing his beautiful
paraphrase of the ninety-eighth Psalm, &ldquo;Joy to the world,
the Lord is come!&rdquo; Another hymn, &ldquo;O God, our help in ages
past,&rdquo; based on the ninetieth Psalm, is indispensable
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
at New Year&rsquo;s time. Then there is the majestic
hymn of worship, &ldquo;Before Jehovah&rsquo;s awful throne,&rdquo; as well
as the appealing Lenten hymn, &ldquo;Alas, and did my Saviour
bleed?&rdquo; And who has not been stirred by the challenge in
&ldquo;Am I a soldier of the cross?&rdquo; Other hymns by Watts include
such favorites as &ldquo;There is a land of pure delight,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove,&rdquo; &ldquo;O that the Lord
would guide my ways,&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear Redeemer and my Lord,&rdquo;
&ldquo;How beauteous are their feet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, sound His praise
abroad,&rdquo; &ldquo;My soul, repeat His praise,&rdquo; &ldquo;O bless the Lord,
my soul,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord of the worlds above,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, we confess
our numerous faults,&rdquo; &ldquo;In vain we seek for peace with
God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Not all the blood of beasts,&rdquo; &ldquo;So let our lips and
lives express,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord my Shepherd is,&rdquo; and &ldquo;When
I can read my title clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Watts never married, he deeply loved little
children, and he is the author of some of the most famous
nursery rhymes in the English language. The profound
genius that produced &ldquo;O God, our help in ages in past&rdquo; also
understood how to appeal to the childish mind by means
of such happy little jingles as, &ldquo;How doth the little busy bee&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Let dogs delight to bark and bite,&rdquo; as well as by the
exquisite cradle-song:</p>

</div>
<div id="c35" title="Doddridge: Preacher, Teacher and Hymnist">
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<h3>DODDRIDGE: PREACHER, TEACHER AND HYMNIST</h3>
<p>Philip Doddridge was one of England&rsquo;s gifted
evangelical preachers. Like the Wesley brothers, he
came from a large family. While there were nineteen
children in the Wesley family, Philip Doddridge was
the last of twenty children.</p>
<p>The religious background of the Doddridge family was
significant. Although his father was an oil merchant in
London, his grandfather had been one of the Independent
ministers under the Commonwealth who were ejected in
1662. Both of his parents were pious people, and Philip,
who was born June 26, 1702, was brought up in a religious
atmosphere.</p>
<p>He was such a delicate child that his life was despaired
of almost from birth. His parents died while he was yet
quite young, but kind friends cared for the orphan boy and
sent him to school.</p>
<p>Because he revealed such unusual gifts as a student, the
Duchess of Bedford offered to give him a university training
on condition that he would become a minister of the
Church of England. This, however, Philip declined to do,
and he entered a nonconformist seminary instead.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-one years he was ordained as pastor
of the Independent congregation at Kibworth, England. Six
years later he began his real life work at Northampton,
where he served as the head of a theological training school
and preached in the local congregation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>To this school came young men from all parts of the
British Isles and even from the continent. Most of them
prepared to become ministers in the Independent Church.
Doddridge himself was practically the whole faculty. Among
his subjects were Hebrew, Greek, Algebra, Philosophy,
Trigonometry, Logic, and theological branches.</p>
<p>As a hymn-writer Doddridge ranks among the foremost
in England. He was a friend and admirer of Isaac Watts,
whose hymns at this time had set all England singing. In
some respects his lyrics resemble those of Watts. Although
they do not possess the strength and majesty found in the
latter&rsquo;s hymns, they have more personal warmth and tenderness.
Witness, for instance, the children&rsquo;s hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See Israel&rsquo;s gentle Shepherd stand</p>
<p class="t">With all-engaging charms;</p>
<p class="t0">Hark! how He calls the tender lambs,</p>
<p class="t">And folds them in His arms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note also the spiritual joy that is reflected in the hymn
so often used at confirmation:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O happy day, that stays my choice</p>
<p class="t">On Thee, my Saviour and my God!</p>
<p class="t0">Well may this glowing heart rejoice,</p>
<p class="t">And tell its raptures all abroad.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Something of Doddridge&rsquo;s own confiding trust in God is
expressed in the beautiful lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Shine on our souls, eternal God!</p>
<p class="t">With rays of beauty shine;</p>
<p class="t0">O let Thy favor crown our days,</p>
<p class="t">And all their round be Thine.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Did we not raise our hands to Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Our hands might toil in vain;</p>
<p class="t0">Small joy success itself could give,</p>
<p class="t">If Thou Thy love restrain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other noted hymns by Doddridge include such gems as
&ldquo;Hark, the glad sound, the Saviour comes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Great God,
we sing that mighty hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Fount of good, to own Thy
love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father of all, Thy care we bless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doddridge wrote about four hundred hymns. Most of
them were composed for use in his own congregation in connection
with his sermons. None of them was published during
his life-time, but manuscript copies were widely circulated
among the Independent congregations in England.
The fact that about one-third of his hymns are still in common
use on both sides of the Atlantic bears witness of their
unusual merit.</p>
<p>Though Doddridge struggled under the burden of feeble
health, his life was filled with arduous duties. When he
was only forty-eight years old it became apparent that he had
fallen a victim to tubercular infection. He was advised to
leave England for Lisbon, Portugal. Lacking funds for the
voyage, friends in all parts of England came to his aid. The
journey was undertaken, but on October 26, 1751, he died
at Lisbon.</p>

<div id="c36" title="Wesley, the Sweet Bard of Methodism">
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h3>WESLEY, THE SWEET BARD OF METHODISM</h3>
<p>Every great religious movement has witnessed an
outburst of song. This was particularly true of the
Lutheran Reformation in Germany and other lands
and of the Methodist revival in England. John and
Charles Wesley, like Martin Luther, understood something
of the value of sacred song in impressing religious truths
upon the hearts and minds of men. While John Wesley
was undoubtedly a preacher of marvelous spiritual power,
the real secret of the success of the Wesleyan movement
more likely must be sought in the sublime hymns written
by his brother Charles.</p>
<p>With Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley holds the foremost
place in the realm of English hymnody. No less than 6,500
hymns are said to have been written by this &ldquo;sweet bard of
Methodism.&rdquo; Naturally they are not all of the highest
order, but it is surprising how many of them rise to real
poetic excellence. Of the 770 hymns in the Wesleyan Hymn
Book, 623 are from the pen of Charles Wesley!</p>
<p>Wesley did not write hymns merely as a duty, nor yet as
a pastime. His soul seemed filled with music and poetry,
and when his genius became touched by the divine spark of
Christ&rsquo;s Spirit, it burst into full flame. It has been said of
Franz Schubert that &ldquo;he had to write music.&rdquo; The same
was true of Charles Wesley. When his soul was full of
song, he had to give expression to it by writing his immortal
hymns. The inspiration came to him under all sorts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
conditions. Some of his hymns were written on horseback,
others in a stage-coach or on the deck of a vessel. Even as
he was lying on his deathbed, at the age of eighty years,
he dictated his last hymn to his faithful and devoted wife.
It begins with the words, &ldquo;In age and feebleness extreme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Wesley was the next to the youngest of nineteen
children born to Rev. Samuel Wesley and his remarkable
wife Susannah. The father, who was a clergyman in the
Church of England, possessed more than ordinary literary
gifts. He is the author of at least one hymn that has survived
the passing of time, &ldquo;Behold, the Saviour of mankind.&rdquo;
The mother presided over the rectory at Epworth,
where both of the distinguished sons were born, and also
looked after the education of the younger children of the
large family. Concerning this very unusual mother and
the spiritual influence she exerted over her children, volumes
have been written.</p>
<p>Poverty and other tribulations descended upon the Epworth
rectory like the afflictions of Job. The crowning
disaster came in 1709, when the Wesley home was completely
destroyed by fire. John, who was only six years old
at the time, was left behind in the confusion and when the
entire house was aflame he was seen to appear at a second-story
window. The agonized father fell upon his knees and
implored God to save his child. Immediately a neighbor
mounted the shoulders of another man and managed to seize
the boy just as the roof fell in. Thus was spared the child
who was destined to become the leader of one of the greatest
spiritual movements in the Christian Church.</p>
<p>While John and Charles were students at Oxford University,
they became dissatisfied with the spiritual conditions
existing among the students. Soon they formed an organization
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
devoted to spiritual exercises. Because of their strict
rules and precise methods, they were nicknamed &ldquo;the Methodists,&rdquo;
a name that afterwards became attached to their
reform movement.</p>
<p>The hymns of Charles Wesley are so numerous that only
a few of the more outstanding can be mentioned here.
&ldquo;Hark! the herald angels sing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love divine, all love excelling&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul&rdquo; form a triumvirate
of hymns never surpassed by a single author. Add to these
such hymns as &ldquo;A charge to keep I have,&rdquo; &ldquo;Arise, my soul,
arise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ, whose glory fills the sky,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, Thou
long-expected Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Soldiers of Christ, arise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hail the
day that sees Him rise,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Suffering Son of Man, be
near me,&rdquo; and it will readily be understood why the name
of Charles Wesley is graven in such large letters in the
hymnody of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul&rdquo; is generally recognized as the
finest hymn of Wesley. This is all the more remarkable
since it was one of the earliest written by him. It was first
published in 1740 in a collection of 139 hymns known as
&ldquo;Hymns and Sacred Poems, by John and Charles Wesley.&rdquo;
This was at the beginning of the Wesleyan movement, which
soon began to spread like fire all over England.</p>
<p>There are several stories extant as to the origin of the
hymn. The most trustworthy of these tells how the author
was deeply perplexed by spiritual difficulties one day, when
he noticed through his open study window a little song bird
pursued by a hungry hawk. Presently the bird fluttered exhausted
through the window and straight into the arms of
Wesley, where it found a safe refuge. Pondering on this
unusual incident, the thought came to Wesley that, in like
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
manner, the soul of man must flee to Christ in doubts and
fears. Then he took up his pen and wrote:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, Lover of my soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me to Thy bosom fly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The reference to the &ldquo;tempest&rdquo; and the &ldquo;storm of life&rdquo;
may have been prompted by the memory of an earlier experience,
when he and his brother John were on their way to
the colony of Georgia on a missionary journey. It was in
the year 1735 the brothers formed a friendship with a band
of Moravians who were sailing on the same ship for
America. During the crossing a terrible tempest was encountered
and for a while it was feared the ship would sink.
While all of the other passengers were filled with terror,
the Wesleys were impressed by the calmness and courage of
the Moravians, who sang hymns in the midst of the raging
storm.</p>
<p>Seeking for a reason for their spiritual fortitude, the
brothers found that the Moravians seemed to possess a positive
certainty of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
The Wesleys also made the sad discovery that they themselves
did not really possess this assurance, but had been
trying to work out their salvation by methods of their own.
John Wesley later made the confession that he and his
brother had gone to Georgia to convert the people there,
whereas they themselves had need to be converted!</p>
<p>Upon their return to London the brothers fell in with
other Moravians, and through them they became familiar
with Luther&rsquo;s teachings. Charles came to a saving faith
in Christ during a severe illness, and a week later his brother
had a similar spiritual experience. It was on May 24,
1738, that John Wesley attended a meeting in Aldersgate
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
Street, where some one was reading Luther&rsquo;s preface to the
Epistle to the Romans. Then for the first time light dawned
on his soul, and he found peace with God through Christ.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards John Wesley left for Halle, Germany,
the seat of the Pietist movement, in order to become more
familiar with the teachings of Luther and the evangelical
methods of the Pietists. At Halle he also became deeply
imbued with missionary zeal. Upon his return to England
he launched, with John Whitefield, the greatest spiritual
movement his country had ever known. Revivals flamed
everywhere. No buildings were large enough to house the
crowds that gathered to hear the evangelists, and, because
the English clergy were hostile to the movement, most of
the meetings were held in the open air.</p>
<p>Charles at first aided in preaching, but eventually devoted
his time mainly to hymns. It is estimated that John
Wesley held no less than forty thousand preaching services,
and traveled nearly a quarter of a million miles. It was
he who said, &ldquo;The world is my parish.&rdquo; John wrote some
original hymns, but his translations of German hymns are
more important. We are indebted to him for the English
versions of Paul Gerhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commit thou all thy griefs,&rdquo;
Tersteegen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thou hidden love of God whose height,&rdquo;
Freylinghausen&rsquo;s &ldquo;O Jesus, Source of calm repose,&rdquo; Zinzendorf&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness,&rdquo; and Scheffler&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Thee will I love, My Strength, my Tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Wesley died March 29, 1788, after fifty years of
service to the Church. The day before he was taken ill,
he preached in City Road chapel, London. The hymn
before the sermon was Watts&rsquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll praise my Maker, while
I&rsquo;ve breath.&rdquo; The following evening, although very sick,
he amazed his friends by singing the entire hymn with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
strong voice. On the night of his death he tried several
times to repeat the hymn, but could only say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll praise&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
praise&mdash;,&rdquo; and with the praise of his Maker on his lips,
he went home to God. John Wesley survived his brother
three years, entering his eternal rest on March 2, 1791.
The text of his last sermon was, &ldquo;Seek ye the Lord while
He may be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Charles Wesley or Isaac Watts should be accorded
first place among English hymnists has been a subject
of much dispute. The fact is that each occupies a
unique position, and the one complements the other. While
Watts dwells on the awful majesty and glory of God in
sublime phrases, Wesley touches the very hem of Christ&rsquo;s
garment in loving adoration and praise. Dr. Breed compares
the two in the following striking manner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watts is more reverential; Wesley more loving. Watts
is stronger; Wesley sweeter. Watts appeals profoundly to
the intellect; Wesley takes hold of the heart. Watts will
continue to sing for the Pauls and Peters of the Church;
Wesley for the Thomases and the Johns. Where both are
so great it would be idle to attempt to settle their priority.
Let us only be grateful that God in His gracious providence
has given both to the Church to voice the praises of various
classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Ward Beecher uttered one of the most beautiful
of all tributes to &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul&rdquo; when he said:
&ldquo;I would rather have written that hymn of Wesley&rsquo;s than
to have the fame of all the kings that ever sat on the earth.
It is more glorious. It has more power in it. I would
rather be the author of that hymn than to hold the wealth
of the richest man in New York. He will die. He <i>is</i> dead,
and does not know it.... But that hymn will go singing
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
until the last trump brings forth the angel band; and then,
I think, it will mount up on some lip to the very presence
of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Duffield, author of &ldquo;Stand up, stand up for
Jesus,&rdquo; called Wesley&rsquo;s lyric &ldquo;the hymn of the ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one will ever know how much help and consolation
it has brought to souls in affliction. Allan Sutherland tells
of the following pathetic incident:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On an intensely warm day, as I stood on the corner
of a sun-baked street in Philadelphia, waiting for a car to
take me to the cool retreats of Fairmount Park, I heard
a low, quavering voice singing, with inexpressible sweetness,
&lsquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul.&rsquo; Looking up to an open window
whence the sound came, I saw on the sill a half-withered
plant&mdash;a pathetic oasis of green in a desert of brick and
mortar&mdash;and resting tenderly and caressingly upon it was
an emaciated hand. I could not see the person to whom
the voice and hand belonged, but that was unnecessary&mdash;the
story was all too clearly revealed: I knew that within
that close, uncomfortable room a human soul was struggling
with the great problem of life and death, and was slowly
but surely reaching its solution; I knew that in spite of her
lowly surroundings her life was going out serenely and
triumphantly. I shall never forget the grave, pathetic pleading
in the frail young voice as these words were borne to
me on the oppressive air:</p>
<div class="bq">

<p class="t">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;</p>

<h3>A GREAT HYMN THAT GREW OUT OF A QUARREL</h3>
<p>Although Isaac Watts&rsquo; beautiful hymn, &ldquo;When
I survey the wondrous cross,&rdquo; is regarded by most
critics as the finest hymn in the English language,
Toplady&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; holds the distinction of being
the most popular. Perhaps no hymn ever written has so
gripped the hearts of Christians of all communions as this
noble hymn.</p>
<p>A British magazine once invited its readers to submit a
list of the hundred English hymns that stood highest in
their esteem. A total of 3,500 persons responded, and &ldquo;Rock
of Ages&rdquo; was named first by 3,215.</p>
<p>We have tried the same experiment with a group of Bible
students, and &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; easily headed the list.</p>
<p>Augustus Montague Toplady, the writer of this hymn,
was born on November 4, 1740, at Farnham, England. His
father, a major in the English army, was killed the following
year at the siege of Carthagena. The widowed mother
later removed to Ireland, where her son was educated at
Trinity College, Dublin. It was during this period of his life
that Augustus, then sixteen years of age, chanced to attend
an evangelistic service held in a barn. The preacher was
an unlettered layman, but his message so gripped the heart
of the lad that he determined then and there to give his
heart to God. Of this experience Toplady afterward wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange that I who had so long sat under the means
of grace in England should be brought right unto God in
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
an obscure part of Ireland, amidst a handful of people met
together in a barn, and by the ministry of one who could
hardly spell his own name. Surely it was the Lord&rsquo;s doing
and is marvelous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toplady was ordained at the age of twenty-two as a minister
of the Church of England. He was frail of body,
and after some years he was stricken with consumption.
It was while fighting the ravages of this disease that he
wrote his famous hymn, two years before his death.</p>
<p>The hymn first appeared in the March issue of the <i>Gospel
Magazine</i>, of which Toplady was editor, in the year 1776.
It was appended to a curious article in which the author
attempted to show by mathematical computation how dreadful
is the sum total of sins committed by a man during a
lifetime, and how impossible it is for a sinner to redeem
himself from this debt of guilt. But Christ, who is the
sinner&rsquo;s refuge, has paid the entire debt. It was this glorious
thought that inspired him to sing:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me hide myself in Thee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For some years John Wesley, the great founder of Methodism,
and Toplady had been engaged in a theological dispute.
Toplady was a confirmed Calvinist and was intolerant
of Wesley&rsquo;s Arminian views. Both men were intemperate
in their language and hurled unseemly and sometimes
bitter invectives at each other. Wesley characterized Toplady
as a &ldquo;chimney-sweep&rdquo; and &ldquo;a lively coxcomb.&rdquo; Toplady
retorted by calling Wesley &ldquo;Pope John&rdquo; and declaring
that his forehead was &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; and &ldquo;impervious to a
blush.&rdquo; There are reasons for believing that the article
in the <i>Gospel Magazine</i> by Toplady to which we have alluded
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
was for the purpose of refuting Wesley&rsquo;s teachings,
and that &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; was written at the conclusion of
the article as an effective way of clinching the argument.</p>
<p>In our day, when we find &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; on one page
of our hymnals and Charles Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my
soul,&rdquo; on the next, it is hard to understand the uncharitable
spirit that existed between these servants of Christ. Perhaps,
had they really understood each other, they were more
in accord than they suspected.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, God is able to use the most imperfect of
human instruments for His praise, and surely &ldquo;Rock of
Ages&rdquo; has been the means of bringing multitudes to God
through Christ. Its strength lies undoubtedly in the clear
and simple manner in which it sets forth the glorious truth
that we are saved by grace alone, through the merits of
Christ. Even a child can understand the meaning of the
words,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nothing in my hand I bring,</p>
<p class="t0">Simply to Thy cross I cling.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Or these,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not the labors of my hands</p>
<p class="t0">Can fulfil Thy Law&rsquo;s demands;</p>
<p class="t0">Could my zeal no respite know,</p>
<p class="t0">Could my tears forever flow,</p>
<p class="t0">All for sin could not atone;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou must save, and Thou alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this comforting and triumphant faith Toplady himself
passed into glory in his thirty-eighth year. A few hours
before his death he exclaimed: &ldquo;My heart beats every day
stronger and stronger for glory. Sickness is no affliction,
pain no curse, death itself no dissolution.&rdquo; His last words
were: &ldquo;My prayers are all converted into praises.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>During his illness some friends had expressed the hope that
he might soon be restored. Toplady shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mortal man can live,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after the glories
which God has manifested to my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time he told how he &ldquo;enjoyed a heaven already
in his soul,&rdquo; and that his spiritual experiences were so exalted
that he could ask for nothing except a continuation of
them.</p>
<p>Before his death Toplady had requested that he be buried
beneath the gallery over against the pulpit of Totenham
Court Chapel. Strangely enough, this building was intimately
associated with the early history of Methodism.
It was built by Whitefield, and here also Wesley preached
Whitefield&rsquo;s funeral sermon. Perhaps it was Toplady&rsquo;s
way of expressing the hope that all the bitterness and rancor
attending his controversy with Wesley might be buried with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; has been translated into almost every
known language, and to all peoples it seems to bring the
same wondrous appeal. An old Chinese woman was trying
to do something of &ldquo;merit&rdquo; in the eyes of her heathen gods
by digging a well twenty-five feet deep and fifteen in diameter.
She was converted to Christianity, and when she
was eighty years old, she held out the crippled hands with
which she had labored all her life and sang: &ldquo;Nothing
in my hands I bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A missionary to India once sought the aid of a Hindu
to translate the hymn into one of the numerous dialects of
India. The result was not so happy. The opening words
were:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Very old stone, split for my benefit,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me get under one of your fragments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>This is a fair example of the difference between poetry
and prose. The translator was faithful to the idea, but
how common-place and unfortunate are his expressions when
compared with the language of the original!</p>

</div>
<div id="c38" title="The Bird of a Single Song">
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<h3>THE BIRD OF A SINGLE SONG</h3>
<p>Some men gain fame through a long life of work
and achievement; others through a single notable
deed. The latter is true in a very remarkable sense
of Edward Perronet, author of the Church&rsquo;s great coronation
hymn, &ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo; Name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perronet, bird of a single song, but O how sweet!&rdquo;
is the charming tribute of Bishop Fess in referring to this
inspired hymn and its author.</p>
<p>Although Perronet was a man of more than ordinary
ability, his name probably would have been lost to posterity
had he not written the coronation hymn. An associate of
the Wesleys for many years, Perronet also wrote three
volumes of sacred poems, some of unusual merit. All of
them, however, have been practically forgotten except his
one immortal hymn. So long as there are Christians on
earth, it will continue to be sung, and after that&mdash;in heaven!</p>
<p>Perronet came from a distinguished line of French Protestants
who had found refuge in England during times of
religious persecution in their homeland. His father, Rev.
Vincent Perronet, was vicar of Shoreham. Both father and
son, though ardent supporters of the Established Church,
became intensely interested in the great evangelical revival
under Whitefield and the Wesleys. At one time young
Perronet traveled with John Wesley. Much opposition
had been stirred up against the Wesleyan movement, and in
some places the preachers were threatened by mobs. Concerning
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
these experiences, Wesley makes the following notation
in his diary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Rockdale we went to Bolton, and soon found that
the Rockdale lions were lambs in comparison with those of
Bolton. Edward Perronet was thrown down and rolled
in mud and mire. Stones were hurled and windows broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion it is recorded that Wesley wanted
to hear Perronet preach. The author of our hymn, however,
seems to have been somewhat reluctant about preaching
in the presence of the great reformer. Wesley, nevertheless,
without consulting Perronet, announced in church
that the young man would occupy the pulpit on the following
morning. Perronet said nothing, but on the morrow he
mounted the pulpit and explained that he had not consented
to preach. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall deliver the best
sermon that has ever been preached on earth,&rdquo; whereupon
he read the Sermon on the Mount from beginning to end,
adding not a word of comment!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo; Name&rdquo; has been translated
into almost every language where Christianity is known, and
wherever it is sung it seems to grip human hearts. One
of the most remarkable stories of the power of this hymn
is related by Rev. E. P. Scott, a missionary to India. Having
learned of a distant savage tribe in the interior to whom
the gospel had not yet been preached, this missionary, despite
the warnings of his friends, packed his baggage and,
taking his violin, set out on his perilous venture. After
traveling several days, he suddenly came upon a large party
of the savages who surrounded him and pointed their spears
at him.</p>
<p>Believing death to be near, the missionary nevertheless
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
took out his violin and with a prayer to God began to sing
&ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo; Name!&rdquo; He closed his eyes
as he sang, expecting every moment to be pierced through
with the threatening spears. When he reached the stanza,
&ldquo;Let every kindred, every tribe,&rdquo; he opened his eyes. What
was his surprise to see every spear lowered, and many of the
savages moved to tears!</p>
<p>He remained for two years and a half, preaching the
story of redemption and leading many of the natives to
Jesus. When he was about to return to America on furlough,
they pleaded, &ldquo;O missionary, come back to us again!&rdquo;
He did so, and finally passed away in the midst of these
people who had learned to love the man who had brought
them the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that, while the people of both
England and America prize this hymn very highly, they
sing it to different melodies. The tune used in America
is called &ldquo;Coronation&rdquo; and was composed by a carpenter of
Charlestown, Mass., by the name of Oliver Holden. This
man was very fond of music and spent his spare time in
playing a little organ on which he composed his tunes.
The organ may still be seen in Boston.</p>
<p>Thus an English minister and an American carpenter
have united in giving the world an immortal hymn.</p>
<p>Perronet died January 2, 1792. His last words were:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Glory to God in the height of His divinity!</p>
<p class="t0">Glory to God in the depth of His humanity!</p>
<p class="t0">Glory to God in His all-sufficiency!</p>
<p class="t0">Into His hands I commend my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two other hymn-writers who, like Perronet, were associated
with the Wesleyan movement may be mentioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
in this connection. They were John Cennick and William
Williams. Like Perronet, too, each was the author of one
great hymn, and through that hymn their names have been
preserved to posterity.</p>
<p>Cennick, who was of Bohemian ancestry, first met John
Wesley in 1739. Of that meeting Wesley has the following
notation in his diary: &ldquo;On Friday, March 1739, I
came to Reading, where I found a young man who had in
some measure known the powers of the world to come. I
spent the evening with him and a few of his serious friends,
and it pleased God much to strengthen and comfort them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while Cennick assisted Wesley as a lay preacher,
but in 1741 he forsook the Methodist movement on account
of Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;free grace&rdquo; doctrines and organized a society
of his own along Calvinistic lines. Later he joined himself
to John Whitefield as an evangelist, but finally he went over
to the Moravians, in which communion he labored abundantly
until his death in 1755 at the early age of thirty-seven
years.</p>
<p>To Cennick we are indebted for the majestic hymn on
the theme of Christ&rsquo;s second coming, &ldquo;Lo! He comes, with
clouds descending.&rdquo; James King, in his &ldquo;Anglican Hymnology,&rdquo;
gives this hymn third place among the hymns of
the Anglican Church, it being excelled in his estimation only
by Bishop Ken&rsquo;s &ldquo;All praise to Thee, my God, this night&rdquo;
and Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hark! the herald angels sing.&rdquo; Cennick
has also bequeathed to the Church the lovely hymn, &ldquo;Children
of the heavenly King.&rdquo; Though he wrote and published
many more hymns, they are mostly of an inferior
order.</p>
<p>Williams, a Welshman by birth, has also left a hymn
that has gone singing down through the centuries. It is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
rugged and stirring hymn that sets forth in such striking
imagery the experiences of the Israelites in the wilderness,
&ldquo;Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams, who earned the title of the &ldquo;Watts of Wales,&rdquo;
wrote the hymn originally in Welsh. Of him it has been
said that &ldquo;He did for Wales what Wesley and Watts did
for England, or what Luther did for Germany.&rdquo; His first
hymn-book, &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; was published in 1744, when he
was only twenty-seven years old.</p>
<p>The Welsh hymnist originally intended to enter the medical
profession, but, after passing through a spiritual crisis,
he was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England. Because
of his free methods of evangelism, he was denied full
ordination, and later identified himself with the Wesleyan
revival. Like Cennick and Perronet, however, he soon forsook
the Wesleys, and now we find him a Calvinistic
Methodist, having adopted Wales as his parish. He was a
powerful preacher and an unusual singer, and for forty-five
years he carried on a blessed work until, on January 11,
1791, he passed through &ldquo;the swelling current&rdquo; and was
landed &ldquo;safe on Canaan&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div id="c39" title="England&rsquo;s First Woman Hymnist">
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<h3>ENGLAND&rsquo;S FIRST WOMAN HYMNIST</h3>
<p>While Isaac Watts was working on his immortal version
of &ldquo;Psalms of David,&rdquo; a baby girl was born
to a Baptist minister at Broughton, fifteen miles
away. The baby was Anne Steele, destined to become England&rsquo;s
first woman hymn-writer. This was in 1716.</p>
<p>Her father, who was a merchant as well as a minister,
served the church at Broughton for sixty years, the greater
part without pay. The mother died when Anne was only
a babe of three years. From childhood the future hymnist
was delicate in health, and in 1735 she suffered a hip injury
which made her practically an invalid for life.</p>
<p>The hardest blow, however, came in 1737, when her
lover, Robert Elscourt, was drowned on the day before he
and Anne were to have been married. The grief-stricken
young woman with heroic faith nevertheless rose above her
afflictions and found solace in sacred song. It is believed
that her first hymn, a poem of beautiful resignation, was
written at this time:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Father, whate&rsquo;er of earthly bliss</p>
<p class="t">Thy sovereign will denies,</p>
<p class="t0">Accepted at Thy throne, let this</p>
<p class="t">My humble prayer arise:</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Give me a calm and thankful heart,</p>
<p class="t">From every murmur free;</p>
<p class="t0">The blessings of Thy grace impart,</p>
<p class="t">And make me live to Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine</p>
<p class="t">My life and death attend,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy presence through my journey shine,</p>
<p class="t">And crown my journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That the Lord heard her prayer may be attested by the
fact that she became the greatest hymn-writer the Baptist
Church has produced. Throughout her life she remained
unmarried, living with her father and writing noble hymns.
In 1760 her first poems appeared in print under the pen
name of &ldquo;Theodosia.&rdquo; Her father at this time makes the
following notation in his diary: &ldquo;This day Nanny sent
part of her composition to London to be printed. I entreat
a gracious God, who enabled and stirred her up to
such a work, to direct it and bless it for the good of many.
I pray God to make it useful, and keep her humble.&rdquo; The
book proved immensely popular, and the author devoted the
profits from its sale to charity.</p>
<p>Miss Steele is the author of 144 hymns and 34 paraphrases
of the Psalms. That many of them breathe a spirit
of melancholy sadness is not to be wondered at, when we
consider the circumstances under which they were written.
Although they do not rise to great poetic heights, their language
is so artless and simple they seem to sing their way
into the heart of the worshiper. When Trinity Episcopal
Church of Boston, in 1808, printed its own hymn-book of
151 hymns, fifty-nine of them, or more than one-third, were
selected from Miss Steele&rsquo;s compositions. The fact that so
many of them are still found in the hymnals of today is another
testimony of their worth.</p>
<p>Among the more famous hymns from her pen are: &ldquo;Father
of Mercies, in Thy Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;How helpless guilty nature
lies,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear Refuge of my weary soul,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
whose tender mercy hears,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou only Sovereign of my
heart,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thou lovely source of true delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>England&rsquo;s pioneer woman hymnist fell asleep in November,
1788, her last words being, &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer
liveth.&rdquo; Her epitaph reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Silent the lyre, and dumb the tuneful tongue,</p>
<p class="t">That sung on earth her great Redeemer&rsquo;s praise;</p>
<p class="t0">But now in heaven she joins the angelic song,</p>
<p class="t">In more harmonious, more exalted lays.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The decades during which Miss Steele lived and wrought
were remarkable for the number of hymn-writers of her own
communion who flourished in England. In addition to Miss
Steele, the Baptist Church produced such hymnists as Samuel
Medley, Samuel Stennett and John Fawcett. Benjamin
Beddome also was a prolific writer of this period, but his
hymns are not of a high order.</p>
<p>Medley lived a dissipated life in the navy until he was
severely wounded in battle in 1759. The reading of a sermon
led to his conversion, and he later became pastor of a Baptist
congregation in Liverpool. His most famous hymns are &ldquo;O
could I speak the matchless worth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Awake, my soul,
to joyful lays.&rdquo; Stennett in 1757 succeeded his father as
pastor of a Baptist church in London, where he gained fame
as a preacher. His best hymns are &ldquo;Majestic sweetness sits
enthroned&rdquo; and &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis finished, so the Saviour cried.&rdquo;
Fawcett was minister of an humble Baptist congregation in
Wainsgate when, in 1772, he received a call to a large London
church. He preached his farewell sermon and had
loaded his household goods on wagons, when the tears of his
parishioners constrained him to remain. A few days later
he wrote the tender lyric, &ldquo;Blest be the tie that binds.&rdquo;
Among his other hymns are &ldquo;How precious is the Book
divine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c40" title="A Slave-trader Who Wrote Christian Lyrics">
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<h3>A SLAVE-TRADER WHO WROTE CHRISTIAN LYRICS</h3>
<p>In one of England&rsquo;s famous old churches there is a
tablet marking the last resting-place of one of its
rectors, and on the tablet this epitaph:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">John Newton</span>, <i>clerk, once an Infidel and Libertine, a
servant of slavers in Africa, was, by the rich Mercy of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned,
and appointed to preach the Faith he had long labored
to destroy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This inscription, written by Newton himself before his
death, tells the strange story of the life of the man who
wrote &ldquo;How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds,&rdquo; and scores
of other beautiful hymns.</p>
<p>Newton was born in London, July 24, 1725. His father
was a sea captain. His mother, a deeply pious woman,
though frail in health, found her greatest joy in teaching
her boy Scripture passages and hymns. When he was only
four years old he was able to read the Catechism.</p>
<p>The faithful mother often expressed the hope to her son
that he might become a minister. However, when the lad
was only seven years of age, the mother died, and he was
left to shift largely for himself. On his 11th birthday he
joined his father at sea, and made five voyages to the
Mediterranean. Through the influence of evil companions and
the reading of infidel literature, he began to live a godless
and abandoned life.</p>
<p>Being pressed into the navy when a war seemed imminent,
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
young Newton deserted. He was captured, however,
and flogged at the mast, after which he was degraded.</p>
<p>At this point his life teems with reckless adventures and
strange escapes. Falling into the hands of an unscrupulous
slave-dealer in Africa, he himself was reduced practically
to the abject condition of a slave. In his misery he gave
himself up to nameless sins. The memory of his mother,
however, and the religious truths which she had implanted
in his soul as a child gave his conscience no peace.</p>
<p>The reading of &ldquo;The Imitation of Christ,&rdquo; by Thomas
&agrave; Kempis, also exerted a profound influence over him, and
a terrifying experience in a storm at sea, together with his
deliverance from a malignant fever in Africa, served to bring
the prodigal as a penitent to the throne of mercy.</p>
<p>After six years as the captain of a slaveship, during which
time Newton passed through many severe struggles in trying
to find peace with God through the observance of a strict
moral life, he met on his last voyage a pious captain who
helped to bring him to a truer and deeper faith in Christ.</p>
<p>For nine years at Liverpool he was closely associated with
Whitefield and the Wesleys, studying the Scriptures in Hebrew
and Greek, and occasionally preaching at religious
gatherings of the dissenters. In 1764 he was ordained as
curate of Olney, where he formed the famous friendship
with the poet William Cowper that gave to the world so
many beautiful hymns.</p>
<p>It was at Newton&rsquo;s suggestion that the two undertook to
write a hymn-book. The famous collection known as &ldquo;The
Olney Hymns,&rdquo; was the result of this endeavor. Of the
349 hymns in this book, Cowper is credited with sixty-six,
while Newton wrote the remainder. &ldquo;How sweet the Name
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
of Jesus sounds&rdquo; appeared for the first time in this collection.
It is a hymn of surpassing tenderness, and ranks
among the finest in the English language.</p>
<p>Other notable hymns, by Newton are: &ldquo;Come, my soul,
thy suit prepare,&rdquo; &ldquo;Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat,&rdquo;
&ldquo;While with ceaseless course the sun,&rdquo; &ldquo;One there is above
all others,&rdquo; &ldquo;For a season called to part,&rdquo; &ldquo;Safely through
another week,&rdquo; &ldquo;On what has now been sown,&rdquo; &ldquo;May the
grace of Christ our Saviour,&rdquo; &ldquo;Though troubles assail us,
and dangers affright,&rdquo; &ldquo;Day of judgment, day of wonders,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Glorious things of thee are spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s life came to a close in London in 1807, after
he had served for twenty-eight years as rector of St. Mary
Woolnoth. Among his converts were numbered Claudius
Buchanan, missionary to the East Indies, and Thomas Scott,
the Bible commentator. In 1805, when his eyesight began
to fail and he could no longer read his text, his friends advised
him to cease preaching. His answer was: &ldquo;What!
shall the old African blasphemer stop while he can speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was nearly eighty years old it was necessary for
a helper to stand in the pulpit to help him read his manuscript
sermons. One Sunday Newton had twice read the
words, &ldquo;Jesus Christ is precious.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have already said
that twice,&rdquo; whispered his helper; &ldquo;go on.&rdquo; &ldquo;John,&rdquo; said
Newton, turning to his assistant in the pulpit, &ldquo;I said that
twice, and I am going to say it again.&rdquo; Then the rafters
rang as the old preacher shouted, &ldquo;<i>Jesus Christ is precious</i>!&rdquo;
Newton&rsquo;s whole life may be said to be summed up in the
words of one of his appealing hymns:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Amazing grace! how sweet the sound</p>
<p class="t">That saved a wretch like me!</p>
<p class="t0">I once was lost, but now am found&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Was blind, but now I see.</p>

<div id="c41" title="An Afflicted Poet Who Glorified God">
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<h3>AN AFFLICTED POET WHO GLORIFIED GOD</h3>
<p>Paul once wrote to the Corinthians: &ldquo;God chose the
weak things of the world, that he might put to shame
the things that are strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very special sense this truth was exemplified in the
life of the poet William Cowper. If God ever made use
of a frail instrument through which to glorify Himself, He
did it in this man. Feeble in health from childhood, with
a sensitive, high-strung mind that ever was on the point of
breaking, he still worked and wrought in such a way that
his sad and feverish life certainly was not lived in vain.</p>
<p>Cowper was born at Great Berkhamstead, England, in
1731. His father was an English clergyman. His mother
died when the child was only six years old. Even as a
youth, he was distressed by frequent mental attacks. He
once wrote pathetically: &ldquo;The meshes of that fine network,
the brain, are composed of such mere spinner&rsquo;s threads in
me that when a long thought finds its way into them it
buzzes, and twangs, and bustles about at such a rate as seems
to threaten the whole contexture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the previous sketch we related how the famous friendship
between the poet and John Newton led to the joint publication
of &ldquo;The Olney Hymns.&rdquo; Newton&rsquo;s idea in suggesting
this project was not merely &ldquo;to perpetuate the remembrance
of an intimate and endeared friendship,&rdquo; as he states
in the preface of the noted collection, but also to occupy
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
Cowper&rsquo;s mind, which already had given signs of approaching
madness.</p>
<p>In 1773, two years after the two friends had begun &ldquo;The
Olney Hymns,&rdquo; Cowper passed through a mental crisis that
almost ended in tragedy. Obsessed with the idea that it was
the divine will that he should offer up his life by drowning
himself in the Ouse river, the afflicted poet ordered a post
chaise, and instructed the driver to proceed to a certain spot
near Olney, where he planned to leap into the river. When
he reached the place, Cowper was diverted from his purpose
when he found a man seated at the exact place where he had
intended to end his life. Returning home, he is said to have
thrown himself on his knife, but the blade broke. His next
attempt was to hang himself, but the rope parted.</p>
<p>After his recovery from this dreadful experience, he was
so impressed by the realization of God&rsquo;s overruling providence
that he was led to write the hymn, &ldquo;God moves in a
mysterious way.&rdquo; It is regarded by many critics as the
finest hymn ever written on the theme of God&rsquo;s providence.
James T. Fields declares that to be the author of such a
hymn is an achievement that &ldquo;angels themselves might envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That God had a purpose in sparing the life of the sorely
tried man is made clear when we learn that Cowper lived for
twenty-seven years after passing through this crisis. Although
he continued to experience some distressing periods,
it was during these years that he wrote some of his most
beautiful hymns. Among these are &ldquo;O for a closer walk
with God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sometimes a light surprises,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus, where&rsquo;er
Thy people meet,&rdquo; &ldquo;In holy contemplation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;There
is a fountain filled with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter hymn has often been criticized because of its
strong figurative language. The expression, &ldquo;a fountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
filled with blood,&rdquo; has proved so offensive to modern taste
that many hymn-books have omitted this touching hymn.
Dr. Ray Palmer, writer of &ldquo;My faith looks up to Thee,&rdquo;
opposed these views vigorously. He once wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such criticism seems to us superficial. It takes the words
as if they were intended to be a literal prosaic statement.
It forgets that what they express is not only poetry, but the
poetry of intense and impassioned feeling, which naturally
embodies itself in the boldest metaphors. The inner sense
of the soul, when its deepest affections are moved, infallibly
takes these metaphors in their true significance, while a cold
critic of the letter misses that significance entirely. He merely
demonstrates his own lack of the spiritual sympathies of
which, for fervent Christian hearts, the hymn referred to
is an admirable expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly it is a hymn that has spread blessings in its path,
and countless are the stories of how it has broken down the
resistance of hardened human hearts. One of these tells how
a Belfast minister once visited a mill where two hundred
girls were employed, many of them from his own congregation.
One girl, when she saw her pastor entering, began to
sing &ldquo;There is a fountain filled with blood.&rdquo; Other girls
took up the lines, and soon the glorious song was ringing
above the noise of all the looms. The manager, who was an
unbeliever, was so moved that he seized his hat and ran from
the building. Later he confessed to the minister, &ldquo;I never
was so hard put to it in all my life. It nearly broke me
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cowper also wrote a number of secular poems that
achieved great fame. &ldquo;The Task,&rdquo; has been called &ldquo;one of
the wisest books ever written, and one of the most charming.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Another poem, &ldquo;John Gilpin,&rdquo; is a very happy and
mirthful narrative.</p>
<p>Although Cowper&rsquo;s mother died in his early childhood, he
never forgot her. When he was fifty-six years old, a cousin
sent him a miniature of his mother. In acknowledging the
gift, he wrote: &ldquo;I had rather possess my mother&rsquo;s picture
than the richest jewel in the British crown; for I loved her
with an affection that her death, fifty years since, has not in
the least abated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cowper died in 1800. Three years before his death, he
lost his lifelong comforter and friend, Mrs. Morley Unwin,
who had cared for him with the solicitude of a mother. The
sorrow was almost too great for his feeble nature, and he
again sank into deepest gloom. At times he thought God
had forsaken him. Only at intervals was he able to resume
his literary work. His last poem was &ldquo;The Castaway,&rdquo;
written March 20, 1799. Through all his spiritual and
mental depression, however, he was ever submissive to the
will of God. But the time of release for this chastened child
of God was at hand.</p>
<p>Bishop Moule tells the story of his departure thus: &ldquo;About
half an hour before his death, his face, which had been wearing
a sad and hopeless expression, suddenly lighted up with
a look of wonder and inexpressible delight. It was as if
he saw his Saviour, and as if he realized the blessed fact,
&lsquo;I am not shut out of Heaven after all!&rsquo; This look of holy
surprise and of joyful adoration remained until he had passed
away, and even as he lay in his coffin the expression was still
there. One who saw him after death wrote that &lsquo;with the
composure and calmness of the face, there mingled also a
holy surprise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>Mrs. Browning, in her poem entitled &ldquo;Cowper&rsquo;s Grave,&rdquo;
concludes with these lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O poets, from a maniac&rsquo;s tongue was poured the deathless singing!</p>
<p class="t0">O Christians, at your cross of hope a hopeless hand was clinging!</p>
<p class="t0">O men, this man in brotherhood your weary paths beguiling,</p>
<p class="t0">Groaned inly while he taught you peace, and died while you were smiling.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is a noble tribute to the deathless work of an afflicted
man, and reminds us that Cowper is still singing his wondrous
theme of &ldquo;redeeming love,&rdquo; although his</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;poor lisping, stammering tongue</p>
<p class="t0">Lies silent in the grave.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div id="c42" title="An Irish Poet and His Hymns">
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<h3>AN IRISH POET AND HIS HYMNS</h3>
<p>There are probably few Protestants who, when they
have sung &ldquo;Come, ye disconsolate, where&rsquo;er ye languish,&rdquo;
have been conscious of the fact that it was
written by a Roman Catholic. There is indeed no place
where the &ldquo;communion of saints&rdquo; becomes so apparent as in
the hymn-books of Christendom. The authors of our great
hymns have come from practically every Christian communion,
proving that in every church group there are souls who
are living in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Thomas Moore, the author of the hymn mentioned above,
is probably better known for his ballads and other poems
than for his hymns. Lovers of English lyric poetry will always
remember him as the writer of &ldquo;The last rose of summer,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The harp that once through Tara&rsquo;s halls,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oft in the
stilly night,&rdquo; and a number of other ballads that have lived
through the years and have made the name of Thomas
Moore famous.</p>
<p>Moore, who was born in Dublin, Ireland, May 28, 1779,
was a man of curious make-up. True to his Celtic nature,
he possessed a fiery temper that often brought him into
embarrassing situations.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, the famous critic, once aroused Moore&rsquo;s ire by
saying unkind things about his poetry. Moore resented this
and promptly challenged Jeffrey to a duel. The authorities
interfered before any blood was shed. It was then discovered
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
that one of the pistols contained no bullet, whereupon
the two men became fast friends.</p>
<p>Moore was one of the few men who ever made a financial
success of the business of writing poetry. For &ldquo;Lalla
Rookh&rdquo; he received $15,000 before a single copy had been
sold.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s hymns, thirty-two in number, first appeared in
his volume of &ldquo;Sacred Songs,&rdquo; published in 1816. Most of
these hymns were written to popular airs of various nations.
They have attained greater popularity in America than in
Great Britain. One of the most famous of his hymns is
&ldquo;Sound the loud timbrel o&rsquo;er Egypt&rsquo;s dark sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like most men of poetic bent, Moore was a poor financier
and business man. At one time he accepted a government
position in the revenue service at Bermuda. He did not enjoy
his tasks, and so he placed his duties in the hands of a
deputy, while he went on a tour of America. The deputy,
however, absconded with the proceeds of a ship&rsquo;s cargo,
whereupon Moore found himself liable for the loss of $30,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, ye disconsolate&rdquo; was so changed by Thomas
Hastings, the great American hymnist, that it almost became
a new hymn. The second line of the first stanza, as Moore
originally wrote it, was:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, at the shrine of God fervently kneel.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second line of the second stanza was also changed by
Dr. Hastings, the original version by Moore being:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hope, when all others die, fadeless and pure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The third line of the second stanza was greatly improved
by the American critic. Moore&rsquo;s line read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here speaks the Comforter, in God&rsquo;s name saying.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But the greatest change was made in the third stanza. This
was practically rewritten by Dr. Hastings. Moore&rsquo;s third
stanza departs very radically and abruptly from true hymn
style. It originally read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, ask the infidel what boon he brings us,</p>
<p class="t">What charm for aching hearts he can reveal,</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet is that heavenly promise Hope sings us&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Earth has no sorrow that God cannot heal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last three years of Moore&rsquo;s life were very unhappy. A nervous
affliction rendered him practically helpless. His death occurred
on February 26, 1852, at the age of seventy-three years.</p>

<div id="c43" title="The Hymn Legacy of an English Editor">
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<h3>THE HYMN LEGACY OF AN ENGLISH EDITOR</h3>
<p>Shortly before James Montgomery died, a friend
asked him, &ldquo;Which of your poems will live?&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;None, sir; nothing, except perhaps a few
of my hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Montgomery was right. Although he wrote a number of
pretentious poems, they have been forgotten. But his hymns
live on. A perusal of almost any evangelical hymn-book
will probably reveal more hymns by this gifted and consecrated
man than by any other author, excepting only Isaac
Watts and Charles Wesley.</p>
<p>What a rich legacy was bequeathed to the Christian
Church by the man who wrote &ldquo;Hail to the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Prayer is the soul&rsquo;s sincere desire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Angels, from the
realms of glory,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the hour of trial,&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are these in
bright array?&rdquo; &ldquo;According to Thy gracious Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come
to Calvary&rsquo;s holy mountain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forever with the Lord,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Lord is my shepherd, no want shall I know,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jerusalem,
my happy home,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go to dark Gethsemane!&rdquo;
Montgomery wrote about four hundred hymns in all, and
nearly one-fourth of these are still in common use.</p>
<p>Montgomery began writing hymns as a little boy. He
was born at Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, November 4, 1771.
His father was a Moravian minister, and it had been determined
that the son James should also be trained for the same
calling. Accordingly he was sent to the Moravian seminary
at Fulneck, Yorkshire, England. The parents, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
were sent to the West Indies as missionaries, and their death
there made it necessary for James to discontinue his schooling.</p>
<p>For a while he worked as a clerk in a store, but this was
entirely distasteful to one who possessed the literary gifts of
Montgomery. At the age of nineteen we find him in London
with a few of his poems in manuscript form, trying to find
a publisher who would print them. In this he was unsuccessful,
and two years later we follow him to Sheffield, where
he became associated with Robert Gales, editor of the Sheffield
Register.</p>
<p>Gales was a radical, and, because he displeased the authorities
by some of his articles, he found it convenient in
1794 to leave England for America. Montgomery, then
only twenty-three years old, took over the publication of the
paper and changed its name to the Sheffield Iris. Montgomery,
however, proved as indiscreet as Gales had been,
and during the first two years of his editorship he was twice
imprisoned by the government, the first time for publishing
a poem in commemoration of &ldquo;The Fall of Bastille,&rdquo; and the
second time for his account of a riot at Sheffield.</p>
<p>In 1797 he published a volume of poems called &ldquo;Prison
Amusements,&rdquo; so named from the fact that some of them
had been written during his imprisonment. In later years
the British government granted him a pension of $1,000 per
year in recognition of his achievements and perhaps by way
of making amends for the indignity offered him by his two
imprisonments.</p>
<p>In Montgomery&rsquo;s hymns we may hear for the first time
the missionary note in English hymnody, reflecting the
newly-awakened zeal for the evangelization of the world
which had gripped the English people. The Baptist Missionary
Society had been organized in 1792; Carey had gone
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
to India as its great apostle; and in 1799 the English Church
Missionary Society had been formed.</p>
<p>In the fervor aroused for foreign missions in England we
may discern a continuation of the impulses which went
forth from the Pietistic movement at Halle, Germany, nearly
a century earlier, when Bartholomew Ziegenbalg and
Henry Pl&uuml;tschau were sent from that cradle of the modern
missionary movement as the first missionaries to India. We
may also see something of the influences emanating from
the great Moravian missionary center at Herrnhut. John
Wesley visited both these places before he began his great
revival in England, and became deeply imbued with zeal
for missions.</p>
<p>Moravian contact with England had resulted in the formation
of many Moravian societies, and it was one of these
that had sent Montgomery&rsquo;s parents as missionaries to the
West Indies. It was not without reason, therefore, that
Montgomery became the first English hymnist to sound the
missionary trumpet. He could never forget that his parents
had given their lives in bringing the gospel to the wretched
blacks of the West Indies. His father&rsquo;s grave was at Barbadoes
and his mother was sleeping on the island of Tobago.
And for the same reason, Montgomery was a bitter opponent
of slavery.</p>
<p>The first missionary note is heard in Montgomery&rsquo;s great
Advent hymn, &ldquo;Hail to the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed,&rdquo; written in
1821. One of the stanzas not usually found in hymn-books
reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Kings shall fall down before Him,</p>
<p class="t">And gold and incense bring;</p>
<p class="t0">All nations shall adore Him,</p>
<p class="t">His praise all people sing;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p class="t0">For He shall have dominion</p>
<p class="t">O&rsquo;er river, sea, and shore,</p>
<p class="t0">Far as the eagle&rsquo;s pinion</p>
<p class="t">Or dove&rsquo;s light wing can soar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two other missionary hymns are &ldquo;Lift up your heads, ye
gates of brass&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hark! the song of jubilee.&rdquo; The latter
sweeps along in triumphant measures:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He shall reign from pole to pole,</p>
<p class="t">With illimitable sway;</p>
<p class="t0">He shall reign, when like a scroll</p>
<p class="t">Yonder heavens have passed away;</p>
<p class="t0">Then the end: beneath His rod</p>
<p class="t">Man&rsquo;s last enemy shall fall:</p>
<p class="t0">Hallelujah! Christ in God,</p>
<p class="t">God in Christ, is all in all!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although &ldquo;Jerusalem, my happy home!&rdquo; ranks highest
among the hymns of Montgomery, judged by the standard
of popular favor, his hymn on prayer and &ldquo;Forever with the
Lord&rdquo; have aroused the most enthusiasm on the part of literary
critics. Julian says of the latter that &ldquo;it is full of lyric
fire and deep feeling,&rdquo; and Dr. Theodore Cuyler declares
that it contains four lines that are as fine as anything in
hymnody. This beautiful verse reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here, in the body pent,</p>
<p class="t">Absent from Thee I roam,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet nightly pitch my moving tent</p>
<p class="t">A day&rsquo;s march nearer home.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Montgomery&rsquo;s last words were words of prayer. After
his usual evening devotion on April 30, 1854, he went to
sleep, a sleep from which he never woke on earth. And so
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
was fulfilled in his own experience the beautiful thought
contained in his glorious hymn on prayer:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Prayer is the Christian&rsquo;s vital breath,</p>
<p class="t">The Christian&rsquo;s native air,</p>
<p class="t0">His watchword at the gates of death&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">He enters heaven with prayer.</p>

<div id="c44" title="Heber, Missionary Bishop and Hymnist">
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h3>HEBER, MISSIONARY BISHOP AND HYMNIST</h3>
<p>In the glorious hymns of Reginald Heber, missionary
bishop to India, we find not only the noblest expression
of the missionary fervor which in his day
was stirring the Church, but also the purest poetry in English
hymnody. Christians of all ages will gratefully remember
the name of the man who wrote the most stirring
of all missionary hymns, &ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains,&rdquo;
as well as that sublime hymn of adoration, &ldquo;Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God Almighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter was regarded by Alfred Tennyson as the
world&rsquo;s greatest hymn.</p>
<p>Born April 21, 1783, at Malpas, Cheshire, England, Heber
was educated at Oxford, where he formed the friendship
of Sir Walter Scott. His gift for writing poetry revealed
itself in this period of his life, when he won a prize for a
remarkable poem on Palestine. It is said that Heber, who
was only seventeen years old at the time, read the poem to
Scott at the breakfast table, and that the latter suggested
one of the most striking lines.</p>
<p>Following the award of the prize, for which young Heber
had been earnestly striving, his parents found him on his
knees in grateful prayer.</p>
<p>For sixteen years Heber served in the obscure parish of
Hodnet as a minister of the Church of England. It was
during this period that all of his hymns were written. He
was also engaged in other literary activities that brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
him some fame. All this while, however, he nourished a
secret longing to go to India. It is said that he would work
out imaginary journeys on the map, while he hoped that
some day he might become bishop of Calcutta.</p>
<p>His missionary fervor at this time is also reflected in the
famous hymn, &ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains,&rdquo; written
in 1819. The allusions to &ldquo;India&rsquo;s coral strand&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ceylon&rsquo;s
isle&rdquo; are an indication of the longings that were running
through his mind.</p>
<p>His earnest prayer was answered in 1822, when at the
age of forty years he was called to the episcopate as bishop
of Calcutta. After three years of arduous work in India,
the life of the gifted bishop was cut short. During this
period he ordained the first native pastor of the Episcopal
Church&mdash;Christian David.</p>
<p>A man of rare refinement and noble Christian personality,
Heber was greatly beloved by all who knew him. &ldquo;One
of the best of English gentlemen,&rdquo; was the tribute accorded
him by Thackeray. It was not until after his death, however,
that he leaped into fame through his hymns.</p>
<p>The story of how &ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains&rdquo; was
written reveals something of the poetic genius of Heber.
It seems that he was visiting with his father-in-law, Dr.
Shipley, vicar and dean of Wrexham, on the Saturday before
Whitsunday, 1819. The dean, who was planning to
preach a missionary sermon the following morning, asked
young Heber to write a missionary hymn that could be
sung at the service. The latter immediately withdrew from
the circle of friends to another part of the room. After
a while the dean asked, &ldquo;What have you written?&rdquo; Heber
replied by reading the first three stanzas of the hymn. The
dean expressed satisfaction, but the poet replied, &ldquo;No, no,
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
the sense is not complete.&rdquo; And so he added the fourth verse&mdash;&ldquo;Waft,
waft, ye winds, His story&rdquo;&mdash;and the greatest missionary
hymn of the ages had been born.</p>
<p>The story of the tune to which the hymn is sung is equally
interesting. A Christian woman in Savannah, Georgia, had
come into possession of a copy of Heber&rsquo;s words. The meter
was unusual, and she was unable to find music to fit the
words. Learning of a young bank clerk who was said to be
gifted as a composer, she sent the poem to him. Within a half
hour it was returned to her with the beautiful tune, &ldquo;Missionary
Hymn,&rdquo; to which it is now universally sung. The
young bank clerk was none other than Lowell Mason, who
afterwards achieved fame as one of America&rsquo;s greatest hymn-tune
composers. The marvel is that both words and music
were written almost in a moment&mdash;by real inspiration, it
would seem.</p>
<p>Bishop Heber&rsquo;s hymns are characterized chiefly by their
lyrical quality. They are unusually rich in imagery. This
may be seen particularly in his beautiful Epiphany hymn,
&ldquo;Brightest and best of the sons of the morning.&rdquo; In some
respects the hymns of Heber resemble the later lyrics of
Henry Francis Lyte, writer of &ldquo;Abide with me, fast falls
the eventide.&rdquo; They ring, however, with a much more joyous
note than the hymns of Lyte, in which are always heard
strains of sadness.</p>
<p>We have already referred to Tennyson&rsquo;s estimate of
Heber&rsquo;s hymn to the Holy Trinity. It should be observed
that this great hymn is one of pure adoration. There is nothing
of the element of confession, petition or thanksgiving in
it, but only worship. Its exalted language is Scriptural
throughout, indeed it is the Word of the Most High. It is
doubtful if there is a nobler hymn of its kind in all the realm
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
of hymnody. The tune to which it is always sung, &ldquo;Nicaea,&rdquo;
was written by the great English composer, Rev. John B.
Dykes, and is comparable to the hymn itself in majesty.</p>
<p>Other fine hymns by Heber include &ldquo;The Son of God
goes forth to war,&rdquo; &ldquo;God that madest earth and heaven,&rdquo;
&ldquo;O Thou, whose infant feet were found,&rdquo; &ldquo;When through
the torn sail,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bread of the world in mercy broken,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;By cool Siloam&rsquo;s shady rill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Altogether Heber wrote fifty-seven hymns, all of which
were published in a single collection after his death. It is
said that every one of them is still in use, a rare tribute to
the genius of this consecrated writer.</p>
<p>Heber&rsquo;s life was closely paralleled in many respects by
another great hymn-writer who lived in the same period.
His name was Sir Robert Grant. He was born two years
later than the gifted missionary bishop and, like Heber, died
in India. Although he did not enter the service of the
Church but engaged in secular pursuits, he was a deeply spiritual
man and his hymns bear testimony of an earnest, confiding
faith in Christ. Between his hymns and those of
Heber there is a striking similarity. The language is chaste
and exalted. The rhythm is faultless. The lines are chiseled
as perfectly as a cameo. The imagery is almost startling in
its grandeur. Take, for example, a stanza from his magnificent
hymn, &ldquo;O worship the King&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O tell of His might, and sing of His grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;</p>
<p class="t0">His chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form,</p>
<p class="t0">And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is something beautifully tender in that other hymn
of Grant&rsquo;s in which he reveals childlike trust in Christ:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When gathering clouds around I view,</p>
<p class="t0">And days are dark, and friends are few,</p>
<p class="t0">On Him I lean, who, not in vain,</p>
<p class="t0">Experienced every human pain;</p>
<p class="t0">He sees my wants, allays my fears,</p>
<p class="t0">And counts and treasures up my tears.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nor would we forget his other famous hymn, &ldquo;Saviour,
when in dust to Thee,&rdquo; based on the Litany. When we
learn that the man who wrote these hymns was never engaged
in religious pursuits, but that his whole life was
crowded with arduous tasks and great responsibilities in filling
high government positions, we have reason to marvel.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Grant was born in the county of Inverness,
Scotland, in 1785. His father was a member of Parliament
and a director of the East India Company. The son also
was trained for political life, and, after graduating from
Cambridge University in 1806, he began the practice of law.
In 1826 he was elected to Parliament, five years later became
privy counselor, and in 1834 he was named governor of
Bombay. He died at Dapoorie, in western India, in 1838.</p>
<p>While a member of Parliament, Sir Robert introduced a
bill to remove the restrictions imposed upon the Jews. The
historian Macaulay made his maiden speech in Parliament
in support of this measure.</p>
<p>Brief mention should also be made here of another of
Bishop Heber&rsquo;s contemporaries who gained undying fame by
a great hymn. He was John Marriott, a minister of the
Church of England, whose missionary hymn, &ldquo;Thou, whose
almighty word,&rdquo; is ranked among the finest in the English
language. Marriott was born in 1780, three years before
Heber&rsquo;s birth, and he died in 1825, a year before the death
of the famous missionary bishop.</p>

<h3>AN INVALID WHO BLESSED THE WORLD</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I am&rdquo; will doubtlessly be sung to the end
of time, and as often as Christians sing it they
will praise God and bless the memory of the woman
who wrote it&mdash;Charlotte Elliott.</p>
<p>This hymn will have a greater value, too, when we know
something of the pain and effort that it cost the writer to
produce it. Miss Elliott was one of those afflicted souls
who scarcely know what surcease from suffering is. Though
she lived to be eighty-two years old, she was never well, and
often endured seasons of great physical distress. She could
well understand the sacrifice made by one who</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Strikes the strings</p>
<p class="t0">With fingers that ache and bleed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of her own afflictions she once wrote: &ldquo;He knows, and
He alone, what it is, day after day, hour after hour, to fight
against bodily feelings of almost overpowering weakness,
languor and exhaustion, to resolve not to yield to slothfulness,
depression and instability, such as the body causes me
to long to indulge, but to rise every morning determined to
take for my motto: &lsquo;If a man will come after Me, let him
deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But God seemed to have had a purpose in placing a heavy
cross upon her. Her very afflictions made her think of other
sufferers like herself and made her the better fitted for the
work that He had prepared for her&mdash;the ministry of comfort
and consolation. How beautifully she resigned herself
to the will of God may be seen in her words: &ldquo;God sees,
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
God guides, God guards me. His grace surrounds me, and
His voice continually bids me to be happy and holy in His
service, just where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I am&rdquo; was written in 1836, and appeared for the
first time in the second edition of &ldquo;The Invalid&rsquo;s Hymn
Book,&rdquo; which was published that year and to which Miss
Elliott had contributed 115 pieces.</p>
<p>The great American evangelist, Dwight L. Moody, once
said that this hymn had probably touched more hearts and
brought more souls to Christ than any other ever written.
Miss Elliott&rsquo;s own brother, who was a minister in the Church
of England, himself wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the course of a long ministry, I hope to have been
permitted to see some fruit of my labors; but I feel far more
has been done by a single hymn of my sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that after the death of Miss Elliott, more than
a thousand letters were found among her papers, in which
the writers expressed their gratitude to her for the help the
hymn had brought them.</p>
<p>The secret power of this marvelous hymn must be found
in its true evangelical spirit. It sets forth in very simple but
gripping words the all-important truth that we are not saved
through any merit or worthiness in ourselves, but by the sovereign
grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ. It also
pictures the utter helplessness and wretchedness of the human
soul, and its inability to rise above its own sins; but
very lovingly it invites the soul to come to Him &ldquo;whose blood
can cleanse each spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn was born out of the author&rsquo;s personal spiritual
experiences. Though a daughter of the Church, brought up
in a pious home, it seems that Miss Elliott had never found
true peace with God. Like so many other seeking souls in
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
all ages, she felt that men must do something themselves
to win salvation, instead of coming to Christ as helpless sinners
and finding complete redemption in Him.</p>
<p>When Dr. Caesar Malan, the noted Swiss preacher of
Geneva, came to visit the Elliott home in Brighton, England,
in 1822, he soon discovered the cause of her spiritual perplexity,
and became a real evangelical guide and counsellor.
&ldquo;You have nothing of merit to bring to God,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;You must come just as you are, a sinner, to the Lamb of
God that taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the remainder of her life, Miss Elliott celebrated
every year the day on which her friend had led her
to Christ, for she considered it to be her spiritual birthday.
Although it was fourteen years later that she wrote her immortal
hymn, it is apparent that she never forgot the words
of Dr. Malan, for they form the very core and essence of it.
The inspiration for the hymn came one day when the frail
invalid had been left alone at the home of her brother. She
was lying on a couch and pondering on the words spoken by
Dr. Malan many years before, when suddenly the whole
glorious truth of salvation as the free gift of God flashed
upon her soul. Then came the heavenly gift. Rising from
her couch, she wrote:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
<p class="t0">But that Thy blood was shed for me,</p>
<p class="t0">And that Thou bidd&rsquo;st me come to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">O Lamb of God, I come, I come!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miss Elliott was the author of some 150 hymns. Perhaps
her finest, aside from her great masterpiece, is &ldquo;My
God, my Father, while I stray.&rdquo; By common consent, Miss
Elliott is given first place among English women hymn-writers.</p>

<div id="c46" title="How Hymns Helped Build a Church">
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<h3>HOW HYMNS HELPED BUILD A CHURCH</h3>
<p>Many of the classic hymns of the Christian Church
have been derived from devotional poems that were
never intended as hymns by their writers. This is
true of the beautiful morning hymn, &ldquo;New every morning
is the love,&rdquo; and the equally beautiful evening hymn, &ldquo;Sun of
my soul, Thou Saviour dear.&rdquo; Both of these gems in the
treasury of hymnody have been taken from one of the most
famous devotional books ever written&mdash;John Keble&rsquo;s &ldquo;The
Christian Year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keble was born at Fairford, England, April 25, 1792, the
son of a country vicar. The only elementary training he received
was at the hands of his gifted father, but at the age
of fifteen years he was ready to enter Oxford University.
Here he distinguished himself as a brilliant scholar, and at
the age of twenty-three he was ordained as a clergyman of
the Church of England. He remained as a tutor at Oxford
for a number of years, but when his mother died he returned
to Fairford to assist his father. Although he received
a number of tempting offers at this time, he preferred to labor
in this obscure parish, where he might be of help and
comfort to his father and his two sisters.</p>
<p>It was not until 1835, when his father died and the home
was broken up, that Keble accepted the vicarage of Hursley,
another humble and scattered parish, with a population of
1,500 people. He married in the same year, and here he and
his devoted wife labored until 1866, when they passed away
within six weeks of each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>It was in 1827, when Keble was only twenty-seven, that
he yielded to the strong entreaties of his father and many of
his friends and consented to publish the volume of poems
known as &ldquo;The Christian Year.&rdquo; The verses follow the
church calendar, and it was the author&rsquo;s desire that the book
should be a devotional companion to the Book of Common
Prayer. For this reason it has been called &ldquo;The Prayer
Book in Poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keble was so modest concerning his work that he refused
to permit the volume to bear his name, and so it was given
to the world anonymously. The work was a marvelous success.
From 1827 to 1867, a year after the author&rsquo;s death,
the book had passed through one hundred and nine editions.
Keble used a large part of the proceeds derived from the
sales of his book in helping to rebuild the church at Hursley.
He also was instrumental in having churches built at Otterbourne
and Ampfield, hamlets that belonged to his parish.</p>
<p>Religious leaders, as well as literary critics, have been
unanimous in rendering tribute to this remarkable volume.
Dr. Arnold, the great schoolmaster of Rugby, speaking of
Keble&rsquo;s poems, says: &ldquo;Nothing equal to them exists in our
language. The knowledge of Scripture, the purity of heart,
and the richness of poetry, I never saw equaled.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a
book,&rdquo; says Canon Barry, &ldquo;which leads the soul up to God,
not through one, but through all of the various faculties
which He has implanted in it.&rdquo; And Dr. Pusey adds: &ldquo;It
taught, because his own soul was moved so deeply; the
stream burst forth, because the heart that poured it out was
full; it was fresh, deep, tender, loving, because he himself
was such; he was true, and thought aloud, and conscience
everywhere responded to the voice of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>The publication of &ldquo;The Christian Year&rdquo; brought Keble
such fame that, in 1831, he was elected professor of poetry
at Oxford. He did not remove thither, but in 1833 he
preached at Oxford his famous sermon on &ldquo;National Apostasy&rdquo;
which is credited with having started the so-called
&ldquo;Oxford Movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This movement had its inception in the earnest desire on
the part of many prominent leaders of the Church of England,
including John Newman, to bring about a spiritual
awakening in the Church. They looked askance at the
evangelistic methods of the Wesleyan leaders and turned
to the other extreme of high church ritualism. All England
was profoundly stirred by a series of &ldquo;Tracts for the Times,&rdquo;
written by Newman and his friends, among them Keble. A
disastrous result of the movement was the desertion of Newman
and a large number of others to the Church of Rome;
but Keble shrank from this final step and remained a high
church Episcopalian.</p>
<p>Although a great part of his later life was occupied with
religious controversy, we would like to remember Keble as
a consecrated Christian poet and an humble parish pastor.
For more than thirty years he labored faithfully among his
people, visiting from house to house. If it was impossible
for a candidate to attend confirmation instruction during
the day, Keble would go to his house at night, armed with
cloak and lantern. He gave each candidate a Bible, in which
he had marked the passages that were to be learned. These
Bibles were highly prized, and some of them are to be found
in Hursley to this day. It was noticed that, whenever the
Vicar prepared to read and explain a passage of Scripture,
he would first bow his head and close his eyes while he asked
for the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>Keble&rsquo;s famous morning hymn, &ldquo;New every morning is
the love,&rdquo; is taken from a poem of sixteen verses. The first
line reads, &ldquo;O timely happy, timely wise.&rdquo; It contains the
two oft quoted stanzas that ought to be treasured in the
heart of every Christian:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The trivial round, the common task,</p>
<p class="t0">Will furnish all we ought to ask,</p>
<p class="t0">Room to deny ourselves; a road</p>
<p class="t0">To bring us daily nearer God.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love</p>
<p class="t0">Fit us for perfect rest above;</p>
<p class="t0">And help us this, and every day,</p>
<p class="t0">To live more nearly as we pray.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The evening hymn is also taken from a longer poem, in
which the author first describes in graphic words the setting
of the sun:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis gone! that bright and orb&eacute;d blaze,</p>
<p class="t0">Fast fading from our wistful gaze;</p>
<p class="t0">Yon mantling cloud has hid from sight</p>
<p class="t0">The last faint pulse of quivering light.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In darkness and in weariness</p>
<p class="t0">The traveler on his way must press,</p>
<p class="t0">No gleam to watch on tree or tower,</p>
<p class="t0">Whiling away the lonesome hour.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then comes the beautiful and reassuring thought:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sun of my soul! Thou Saviour dear,</p>
<p class="t0">It is not night if Thou be near!</p>
<p class="t0">O may no earthborn cloud arise</p>
<p class="t0">To hide Thee from Thy servant&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>The peculiar tenderness in Keble&rsquo;s poetry is beautifully
illustrated in the second stanza:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When the soft dews of kindly sleep</p>
<p class="t0">My wearied eyelids gently steep,</p>
<p class="t0">Be my last thought, how sweet to rest</p>
<p class="t0">Forever on my Saviour&rsquo;s breast.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other familiar hymns by Keble are &ldquo;The Voice that
breathed o&rsquo;er Eden,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blest are the pure in heart,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;When God of old came down from heaven.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div id="c47" title="A Famous Hymn by a Proselyte of Rome">
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<h3>A FAMOUS HYMN BY A PROSELYTE OF ROME</h3>
<p>When the children of Israel were about to resume the
march from Mount Sinai and Moses had received
the command to lead the people into the unknown
wilderness, we are told in Exodus that Moses hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the great leader, &ldquo;Thou sayest unto me, &lsquo;Bring
up this people&rsquo;: and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou
wilt send with me.&rdquo; And God answered, &ldquo;My presence shall
go with thee, and I will give thee rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this sublime thought of the guiding presence of
God that gave to John Henry Newman the inspiration for
&ldquo;Lead, kindly Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was much of tragedy in the strange life of Newman.
He was born in London, the son of a banker, February
21, 1801. It is said that he was extremely superstitious
as a boy, and that he would cross himself, after the
custom of Roman Catholics, whenever he entered a dark
place. He also came to the conclusion that it was the will
of God that he should never marry.</p>
<p>He graduated from Trinity College, Oxford, at the age
of nineteen, and four years later was ordained as a minister
of the Church of England. He soon began to be attracted
by Roman Catholic teachings and to associate with leaders
of that communion. In 1833 he was in poor health, and determined
to go to Italy. This was the year of the famous
&ldquo;Oxford Movement,&rdquo; which was destined to carry so many
high Anglicans into the Roman communion. While in Rome
he came still further under the influence of the Romanists,
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
who lost no opportunity to take advantage of his perplexed
state of mind. Leaving Rome, he went down to Sicily, where
he was stricken with fever and was near death. After his
recovery, his one thought was to return to his native shores.
He writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was aching to get home; yet for want of a vessel was
kept at Palermo for three weeks. At last I got an orange-boat
bound for Marseilles. We were becalmed a whole
week on the Mediterranean Sea. Then it was (June 16,
1833) that I wrote the lines: &lsquo;Lead, kindly Light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn, therefore, may be said to be the work of a
man who found himself in deep mental, physical, and spiritual
distress. Newman was greatly dissatisfied with conditions
within his own Church. In his perplexity he scarcely
knew where to turn, but he had no intention at this time,
as he himself states, to forsake the Church of England for
the Roman Catholic communion. This step was not taken
by him until twelve years later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead, kindly Light&rdquo; was published for the first time in
&ldquo;The British Magazine,&rdquo; in the month of March, 1834.
It bore the title, &ldquo;Faith&mdash;Heavenly Leadings.&rdquo; Two years
later he printed it with the title, &ldquo;Light in the Darkness,&rdquo;
and the motto, &ldquo;Unto the godly there ariseth up light in the
darkness.&rdquo; At a later date he published it under the title,
&ldquo;The Pillar of the Cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newman ascribed its popularity as a hymn to the appealing
tune written for it in 1865 by Dr. John B. Dykes. As
to its poetic qualities there has been the widest divergence
of opinion. While one critic has called it &ldquo;one of the outstanding
lyrics of the nineteenth century,&rdquo; William T. Stead
observes, caustically, that &ldquo;It is somewhat hard for the
staunch Protestant to wax enthusiastic over the invocation
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
of a &lsquo;Kindly Light&rsquo; which led the author straight into the
arms of the Scarlet Woman of the Seven Hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn has often been attacked on the ground that it
is not definitely Christian in character. In this respect it is
similar to Mrs. Adams&rsquo; famous hymn, &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to
Thee.&rdquo; When the Parliament of Religions convened in
Chicago a few years ago, Newman&rsquo;s hymn was the only one
sung by representatives of all creeds from every part of the
world. Bishop Bickersteth of England, feeling the need of
the Christian note in the hymn, added the following stanza:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Meantime along the narrow rugged path</p>
<p class="t3">Thyself hast trod,</p>
<p class="t0">Lead, Saviour, lead me home in childlike faith,</p>
<p class="t3">Home to my God</p>
<p class="t0">To rest for ever after earthly strife</p>
<p class="t0">In the calm light of everlasting life.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was done, said Bishop Bickersteth, &ldquo;from a deep
conviction that the heart of the belated pilgrim can only find
rest in the Light of Light.&rdquo; The additional stanza, however,
has not come into general use.</p>
<p>Many interpretations have been given to the closing lines,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And with the morn those angel faces smile,</p>
<p class="t0">Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some have believed that Newman by &ldquo;angel faces&rdquo; had in
mind loved ones lost through death. Yet others are convinced
that the author had reference to the actual visions of
angels which are said to have come to him in youth, and the
loss of which greatly grieved him in later life. Newman
himself, in a letter written January 18, 1879, refused to
throw further light on the lines, pleading that he had forgotten
the meaning that he had in mind when the hymn was
written forty-six years before.</p>
<p>Rome honored its distinguished proselyte by making him
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
a cardinal. It is said, however, that Newman was never
again a happy man after having surrendered the faith of his
fathers. He died at Birmingham, England, August 11,
1890, at the age of eighty-nine years.</p>
<p>A disciple of Newman&rsquo;s, Frederick William Faber, may
be mentioned in this connection, for the lives of the two
men were strangely intertwined. Faber, who was the son
of an English clergyman, was born at Yorkshire, June 28,
1814. He was graduated from Oxford in 1836, and became
a minister of the English Church at Elton in 1843.</p>
<p>While at Oxford he came under the influence of the &ldquo;Oxford
Movement&rdquo; and formed a deep attachment for Newman.
It was inevitable, therefore, that he too should be carried
into the Roman Church, which communion he joined
in 1846. For some years he labored with Newman in the
Catholic church of St. Philip Neri in London. He died in
1863 at the age of forty-nine years.</p>
<p>Faber wrote a large number of hymns, many of them before
his desertion to the Church of Rome. Others, written
after his defection, containing eulogies of Mary and petitions
addressed to the saints, have been changed in order to
make them suitable for Protestant hymn-books. His inordinate
use of the word &ldquo;sweet&rdquo;, and his familiar manner of
addressing Christ as &ldquo;sweet Saviour&rdquo; has called down harsh
criticism on his hymns as sentimental and effeminate. However,
such hymns as &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wideness in God&rsquo;s mercy,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hark, hark, my soul! angelic songs are swelling,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Saviour,
bless us ere we go,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Paradise, O Paradise,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Faith of our fathers, living still&rdquo; have probably found a
permanent place in the hymn-books of the Church Universal,
and will be loved and cherished both for their devotional
spirit and their poetic beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Faber wrote &ldquo;Faith of our fathers&rdquo; after his defection
to the Church of Rome. In its original form the author
expressed the hope that England would be brought back to
the papal fold. The opening lines, as Faber wrote them,
were:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Faith of our fathers! Mary&rsquo;s prayers</p>
<p class="t0">Shall win our country back to thee.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<h3>HENRY FRANCIS LYTE AND HIS SWAN SONG</h3>
<p>Many a man who has labored in obscure places, practically
unnoticed and unpraised by his own generation,
has achieved a fame after his death that grows
in magnitude with the passing years.</p>
<p>When Henry Francis Lyte died in 1847, he was little
known beyond his humble seashore parish at Lower Brixham,
England; but today, wherever his beautiful hymns are
sung throughout the Christian world, he is gratefully remembered
as the man who wrote &ldquo;Abide with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to a questionnaire sent to American readers
recently by &ldquo;The Etude,&rdquo; a musical magazine, 7,500 out of
nearly 32,000 persons who replied named &ldquo;Abide with me&rdquo;
as their favorite hymn. It easily took first rank, displacing
such older favorites as &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus, Lover
of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How often we have sung this hymn at the close of an
evening service, and a settled peace has come into our hearts
as we have realized the nearness of Him who said, &ldquo;And lo!
I am with you always.&rdquo; Yet, this is not in reality an evening
hymn. Its theme is the evening of life, and it was
written when Lyte felt the shadows of death gathering about
his own head. We catch his meaning in the second stanza:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Swift to its close ebbs out life&rsquo;s little day;</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s joys grow dim, its glories pass away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lyte was always frail in health. He was born in Scotland,
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
June 1, 1793, and was early left an orphan. Nevertheless,
despite the handicap of poverty, he struggled through
college, and on three occasions won prizes with poems.</p>
<p>His first ambition was to become a physician, but during
his college days he determined to enter the ministry. The
death of a young friend, a brother clergyman, brought about
a profound change in the spiritual life of Lyte. Called to
the bedside of his friend to give him consolation, he discovered
to his sorrow that both he and the dying man were
blind guides who were still groping for light. Through a
prayerful search of the Scriptures, however, they both came
to a firm faith in Christ. Lyte wrote of his friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died happy under the belief that though he had deeply
erred, there was <i>One</i> whose death and sufferings would
atone for his delinquencies, and that he was forgiven and accepted
for His sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the change that came into his own life, he
added: &ldquo;I was greatly affected by the whole matter, and
brought to look at life and its issue with a different eye than
before; and I began to study my Bible and preach in another
manner than I had previously done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For nearly twenty-five years after this incident Lyte labored
among humble fisherfolk and sailors of the parish
at Lower Brixham, and his deep spiritual zeal and fervor led
him to overtax his physical powers. From time to time he
was obliged to spend the winters in more friendly climes.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1847 he wrote to a friend that the swallows
were flying southward, and he observed, &ldquo;They are
inviting me to accompany them; and yet alas; while I am
talking of flying, I am just able to crawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sunday for his farewell service came. His family
and friends admonished him not to preach a sermon, but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
conscientious minister insisted. &ldquo;It is better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
<i>wear</i> out than to <i>rust</i> out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did preach, and the hearts of his hearers were full that
day, for they seemed to realize that it would probably be the
last time they would hear him. The faithful pastor, too,
seemed to have a premonition that it would be his last sermon.
The service closed with the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, administered
by Lyte to his sorrowing flock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though necessarily much exhausted by the exertion and
excitement of this effort,&rdquo; his daughter afterward wrote,
&ldquo;yet his friends had no reason to believe that it had been
hurtful to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was September 4, 1847. That afternoon he walked
out along the shore to watch the sun as it was setting in a
glory of crimson and gold. It was a peaceful, beautiful Sabbath
evening. Returning to his home, he shut himself up in
his study for the brief space of an hour, and when he came
out, he handed a near relative the manuscript containing the
famous hymn, &ldquo;Abide with me.&rdquo; He also had composed a
tune of his own for the words, but this never came into general
use.</p>
<p>During the following week Lyte left his beloved England
for Italy. However, he got no farther than Nice, in France,
where he was obliged to discontinue his journey. Here he
passed away November 20 of the same year. His last
words were, &ldquo;Joy! Peace!&rdquo; and then he fell asleep.</p>
<p>A little cross marks his grave in the English cemetery at
Nice, for he was buried there. Every year hundreds of pilgrims
visit his grave and tell touching stories of how Lyte&rsquo;s
hymn brought them to faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>It was Lyte&rsquo;s life-long wish that he might leave behind
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
him such a hymn as this. In an earlier poem he had voiced
the longing that he might write</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Some simple strain, some spirit-moving lay,</p>
<p class="t0">Some sparklet of the soul that still might live</p>
<p class="t">When I was passed to clay....</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">O Thou! whose touch can lend</p>
<p class="t0">Life to the dead, Thy quick&rsquo;ning grace supply,</p>
<p class="t">And grant me, swanlike, my last breath to spend</p>
<p class="t0">In song that may not die!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lyte&rsquo;s prayer was fulfilled. As long as men shall worship
the crucified and risen Lord, so long will they continue to
sing the sad and beautiful words of Lyte&rsquo;s swan song.</p>
<p>In Lyte we have a hymn-writer of the first rank. Indeed,
he is comparable to any of England&rsquo;s greatest hymnists, not
excepting Watts or Wesley. His hymns are real lyrics,
Scriptural in language, rich in imagery, and exalted in poetic
conception. &ldquo;In no other author,&rdquo; says an eminent authority,
&ldquo;is poetry and religion more exquisitely united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from the sublime hymn we have mentioned, Lyte
has given to the Church such noble lyrics as &ldquo;Jesus, I my
cross have taken,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pleasant are Thy courts above,&rdquo; &ldquo;Praise,
my soul, the King of heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;God of mercy, God of
grace,&rdquo; &ldquo;My spirit on Thy care,&rdquo; &ldquo;As pants the hart for
cooling streams,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo; The
latter hymn is one of the few ever written that voice a
prayer for the salvation of Israel.</p>
<p>The poetic rapture to which Lyte&rsquo;s poetry sometimes rises
is most beautifully reflected in his hymn of adoration:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;</p>
<p class="t">To His feet thy tribute bring;</p>
<p class="t0">Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,</p>
<p class="t">Who like thee His praise should sing?</p>
<p class="t3">Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t">Praise the everlasting King!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise Him for His grace and favor</p>
<p class="t">To our fathers in distress;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him, still the same as ever,</p>
<p class="t">Slow to chide, and swift to bless:</p>
<p class="t3">Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
<p class="t">Glorious in His faithfulness!</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<h3>SARAH ADAMS AND THE RISE OF WOMEN HYMN-WRITERS</h3>
<p>Nineteenth century hymnody was characterized
by an extraordinary number of women hymn-writers.
It is significant that this development came, as we
have noted in a previous chapter, with the great spiritual
revivals which aroused evangelical Europe and America
from 1800 to 1875. It was also coincident with the general
movement resulting in the enlargement of women&rsquo;s influence
and activity in all spheres of human endeavor. In
the realm of hymnody women have become the chief exponents
of church song.</p>
<p>Dr. Breed has pointed out that the large increase of
women hymnists, as well as the preponderance of hymn
translations, is indicative of a period of decadence in sacred
song. While this is probably true of the latter half of the
nineteenth century, which saw the rise of the so-called &ldquo;Gospel
song,&rdquo; we must cheerfully recognize the fact that such
women as Charlotte Elliott, Sarah Adams, Cecil Alexander
and Frances Havergal in England and Mary Lathbury, Anna
Warner, Catherine Esling, Harriet Beecher Stowe,
Phoebe Gary, Elizabeth Prentiss and Fanny Crosby in
America have contributed some of the most precious gems
to the treasure-store of Christian hymns. Indeed, the hymnody
of the Church would have been immeasurably poorer
had these consecrated women failed to make use of their
heaven-born talent.</p>
<p>And, although we must deplore the apparent fact that
&ldquo;original utterance in sacred song is departing from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
Church,&rdquo; we must be forever grateful to such gifted women
as Catherine Winkworth and the Borthwick sisters, who,
through their excellent translations, gave to the English-speaking
world some of the choicest pearls of German hymnody.</p>
<p>Charlotte Elliott was the forerunner of the long line of
women hymnists. Then came Sarah Flower Adams, the
writer of &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,&rdquo; one of the greatest
sacred lyrics ever given to the world, and probably the
finest ever written by a woman.</p>
<p>Sarah Flower was born at Harlow, England, February
22, 1805, the daughter of Benjamin Flower, editor of the
Cambridge &ldquo;Intelligencer.&rdquo; The mother died when Sarah
was only five years old. A sister, Eliza, was a gifted musician,
while Sarah early showed talent along literary lines.
In later years Eliza wrote music for the hymns of her sister.</p>
<p>Sarah was fond of the stage. She believed that it could
be made to teach great moral truths as well as the pulpit.
Her dreams of becoming an actress, however, failed to materialize
because of poor health. In 1834 she became the
wife of John Bridges Adams, a civil engineer, after which
she made her home in London. Her health was seriously
impaired through caring for her sister, who died a consumptive
in 1846, and she survived her less than two years.</p>
<p>Her great hymn was written in 1840. It was published
the following year in a volume of hymns and anthems edited
by her pastor, Rev. William Johnson Fox. This man was
a Unitarian, and for this reason Mrs. Adams has also been
classified with that sect. It is said, however, that she became
a Baptist near the close of her life. Other hymns written
by her indicate that she had arrived at a living faith in
Christ. Perhaps the many trials she suffered proved in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
end to be the means of bringing her to the Saviour. And
thus was fulfilled in her own life the beautiful lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">E&rsquo;en though it be a cross</p>
<p class="t">That raiseth me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee&rdquo; has probably aroused more
discussion than any other hymn. Because it is based entirely
on the story of Jacob at Bethel and omits reference to
Christ, it has been called more Unitarian than Christian.
Many efforts have been made, but without much success, to
write a substitute hymn with a definite Christian note. In
1864 Bishop How of London wrote a hymn, the first stanza
of which reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nearer, O God, to Thee!</p>
<p class="t2">Hear Thou our prayer;</p>
<p class="t0">E&rsquo;en though a heavy cross</p>
<p class="t2">Fainting we bear.</p>
<p class="t0">Still all our prayer shall be</p>
<p class="t0">Nearer, O God, to Thee,</p>
<p class="t2">Nearer to Thee!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Prof. Henry Eyster Jacobs of Philadelphia, in 1887, also
wrote a version:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nearer, my God, to Thee,</p>
<p class="t2">Nearer to Thee!</p>
<p class="t0">Through Word and Sacrament</p>
<p class="t2">Thou com&rsquo;st to me.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy grace is ever near,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Spirit ever here</p>
<p class="t2">Drawing to Thee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hymn was a favorite with William McKinley, the
martyred president. When he was dying, his attending
physician heard him murmur, &ldquo;&lsquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,
E&rsquo;en though it be a cross,&rsquo; has been my constant prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c50" title="A Hymn Written in a Stage-Coach">
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<h3>A HYMN WRITTEN IN A STAGE-COACH</h3>
<p>Some one has said, &ldquo;Let me write the songs of a
nation, and I care not who may write its laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a wise saying; for who can estimate the influence
of the songs we sing, especially the songs of children?
There is no better way to teach Christian truths to
children than to have them sing those truths into their hearts
and souls.</p>
<p>When Jemima Luke sat in an English stage-coach in 1841
composing the lines of a little poem that had been ringing
in her mind, she could scarcely have known she was
writing a hymn that would gladden the hearts of thousands
of children in many years to come. But that is how she wrote
&ldquo;I think when I read that sweet story of old,&rdquo; and that is
the happy fate that was in store for her labor of love.</p>
<p>Her maiden name was Jemima Thompson. Her father
was a missionary enthusiast, and she herself was filled with
zeal for mission enterprises. Even as a child, at the age
of thirteen, she was an anonymous contributor to &ldquo;The Juvenile
Magazine.&rdquo; When she was twenty-eight years old
she visited a school where the children had been singing a
fine old melody as a marching song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely children&rsquo;s hymn it would make,&rdquo; she
thought, &ldquo;if only there were suitable religious words for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hunted through many books for the words she desired,
but could find none that satisfied her. Some time later, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
she was riding in a stage coach with nothing to occupy her,
she thought of the tune again. Taking an old envelope from
her pocket, she recorded on the back of it the words that
have come to be loved on both sides of the Atlantic, and some
day probably will be sung by the children of all the world.</p>
<p>When she returned home, she taught the words and the
melody to her Sunday school class. Her father, who was
superintendent of the school, chanced to hear them one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that hymn come from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jemima made it!&rdquo; was the proud answer of the youngsters.</p>
<p>Without telling his daughter about it, the father sent a
copy of the words to the &ldquo;Sunday School Teachers&rsquo; Magazine,&rdquo;
and in a few weeks it appeared for the first time in
print. Since that time it has continued to find a place year
after year in almost every juvenile hymnal published in the
English language.</p>
<p>The last stanza of the hymn, which begins with the words,
&ldquo;But thousands and thousands who wander and fall,&rdquo; was
added subsequently by the author, who desired to make it
suitable for missionary gatherings. Her interest in foreign
missions continued unabated throughout her life. At one
time she was accepted as a missionary to the women of India,
but poor health prevented her from carrying out her purpose.
However, she edited &ldquo;The Missionary Repository,&rdquo; the first
missionary magazine for children, and numbered among her
contributors such famous missionaries as David Livingstone,
Robert Moffatt and James Montgomery.</p>
<p>In 1843 she married a minister, Rev. Samuel Luke. After
his death in 1868 she devoted much of her time to promoting
the erection of parsonages in parishes that were too poor to
provide them for their pastors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>When an international convention of the Christian Endeavor
society was held in Baltimore in 1904, Mrs. Luke
sent the following message to the young people:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear children, you will be men and women soon, and it
is for you and the children of England to carry the message
of a Saviour&rsquo;s love to every nation of this sin-stricken world.
It is a blessed message to carry, and it is a happy work to do.
The Lord make you ever faithful to Him, and unspeakably
happy in His service! I came to Him at ten years of age,
and at ninety-one can testify to His care and faithfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She died in 1906 at the age of ninety-three years. Although
she wrote a great deal of inspiring Christian literature,
it is only her beautiful &ldquo;Sweet Story of Old&rdquo; that has
come down to us.</p>

</div>
<div id="c51" title="An Archbishop&rsquo;s Wife Who Wrote Hymns">
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<h3>AN ARCHBISHOP&rsquo;S WIFE WHO WROTE HYMNS</h3>
<p>Shortly before the death in 1911 of Archbishop
William Alexander, primate of the Anglican Church
in Ireland, he remarked that he would be remembered
as the husband of the woman who wrote &ldquo;The roseate
hues of early dawn&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is a green hill far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humble prelate was right. Although he occupied an
exalted position in the Church less than two decades ago,
few people today recall his name. But who has not heard
the name of Cecil Frances Humphreys Alexander, who, in
spite of multitudinous duties as wife and mother, found time
to be a parish worker among the poor and to write hymns
that shall never die?</p>
<p>When Cecil Frances was only a little girl, she began to
reveal poetic talent. Because her father was an officer in
the Royal Marines and rather a stern man, she was not sure
that he would be pleased with her efforts and therefore she
hid her poems under a carpet! When he finally discovered
what his nine-year-old daughter was busying herself with,
he set aside a certain hour every Saturday evening, at which
time he read aloud to the family the poems she had written.</p>
<p>The family numbered among its friends none other than
John Keble, writer of the famous collection of devotional
poems known as &ldquo;The Christian Year,&rdquo; and he, too, gave
encouragement to the youthful poet.</p>
<p>In 1848, at the age of twenty-five, she published a volume
of hymns for little children that probably has never been excelled
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
by a similar collection. Two years later she became
the bride of Rev. William Alexander, afterwards Bishop of
Derry and Raphoe, and later Archbishop of Armaugh. He
was rector of a country parish in the county of Tyrone at
the time, and there was much poverty among his people.
Among these needy folk the young minister&rsquo;s wife moved
about like a ministering angel. A beautiful tribute to her
memory from the pen of her husband reads: &ldquo;From one
poor home to another, from one bed of sickness to another,
from one sorrow to another, she went. Christ was ever with
her, and in her, and all felt her influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the poetic spark within her was not permitted to languish.
Even when children began to bless this unusual
household and the cares of the mother increased, her harp
was tuned anew and sweeter songs than ever began to well
up from her joyous, thankful heart.</p>
<p>Practically all of the four hundred hymns and poems
written by Mrs. Alexander were intended for children, and
for this reason their language is very simple. At the same
time she succeeds in teaching some of the most profound
truths of the Christian faith. Witness, for example, the
simple language of &ldquo;There is a green hill far away.&rdquo; A
child has no difficulty in comprehending it, and yet this precious
hymn sets forth in a most touching way the whole
story of the Atonement.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He died that we might be forgiven,</p>
<p class="t">He died to make us good,</p>
<p class="t0">That we might go at last to heaven,</p>
<p class="t">Saved by His precious blood.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, the infinite value of the sacrifice which Christ made
when He, the Sinless One, died for sinners is expressed in
these simple, appealing words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was no other good enough</p>
<p class="t">To pay the price of sin,</p>
<p class="t0">He only could unlock the gate</p>
<p class="t">Of heaven, and let us in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Archbishop Alexander mentioned two hymns by which his
wife&rsquo;s name, and incidentally his own, would be remembered.
He might have added several others, such as the challenging
hymn, &ldquo;Jesus calls us; o&rsquo;er the tumult,&rdquo; or the two
beautiful children&rsquo;s hymns, &ldquo;Once in royal David&rsquo;s city&rdquo; and
&ldquo;All things bright and beautiful.&rdquo; And among her splendid
poems he might have mentioned the sublime verses entitled
&ldquo;The Burial of Moses.&rdquo; Her own spirit of confiding
trust in God is reflected in the lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O lonely tomb in Moab&rsquo;s land!</p>
<p class="t">O dark Beth-peor&rsquo;s hill!</p>
<p class="t0">Speak to these curious hearts of ours,</p>
<p class="t">And teach them to be still;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God has His mysteries of grace,</p>
<p class="t">Ways that we cannot tell;</p>
<p class="t0">He hides them deep, like the secret sleep</p>
<p class="t">Of him He loved so well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Alexander died in 1895 at the age of seventy-two
years. She was buried in Londonderry, Ireland. At Archbishop
Alexander&rsquo;s funeral sixteen years later &ldquo;The roseate
hues of early dawn&rdquo; was sung in Londonderry cathedral,
and when the body was lowered into the grave the mourners
sang, &ldquo;There is a green hill far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the years when Mrs. Alexander was penning her
beautiful lyrics, three other women were giving hymns to
the English people in another way. They were Catherine
Winkworth and the sisters Jane Borthwick and Sarah
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
Borthwick Findlater, all three of whom had conceived a
deep love for the wonderful hymns of Germany and were
translating them into their native tongue.</p>
<p>Miss Winkworth, who is the foremost translator of German
hymns, was born in London, September 13, 1829. Her
&ldquo;Lyra Germanica,&rdquo; published in 1855, met with such favorable
reception that a second series was issued in 1858.
Her &ldquo;Christian Singers of Germany&rdquo; was published in 1869.</p>
<p>Miss Winkworth possessed a marvelous ability of preserving
the spirit of the great German hymns while she
clothed them in another language. It was she who gave
us in English dress such magnificent hymns as Rinkart&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Now thank we all our God,&rdquo; Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;Out of the depths
I cry to Thee,&rdquo; Decius&rsquo; &ldquo;All glory be to God on high,&rdquo;
Neander&rsquo;s &ldquo;Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of
creation,&rdquo; Schmolck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open now thy gates of beauty,&rdquo; and
Gerhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;All my heart this night rejoices.&rdquo; Miss Winkworth,
more than any other one person, is responsible for
having aroused in England and America an appreciation of
the treasure store of German hymnody. She died in 1869.</p>
<p>The two Borthwick sisters, Jane Laurie and Sarah, were
born in Edinburgh, Scotland, the former in 1813 and the
latter in 1823. They came from an old Scotch family.
Sarah married a Rev. Eric Findlater and lived for a time
in Perthshire.</p>
<p>The Borthwick sisters collaborated in the preparation of
the translations entitled &ldquo;Hymns from the Land of Luther.&rdquo;
These appeared first in 1854 and continued in four
series until 1862. Although it is difficult to distinguish
the individual work of the sisters, Jane is generally credited
with the translation of such noble hymns as Zinzendorf&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Jesus, still lead on,&rdquo; and Schmolck&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Jesus, as Thou
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
wilt,&rdquo; while Sarah is believed to be the translator of Tersteegen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;God calling yet,&rdquo; Spitta&rsquo;s &ldquo;O happy home, where
Thou art loved the dearest,&rdquo; Schmolck&rsquo;s &ldquo;My God, I know
that I must die,&rdquo; and a large number of other famous German
hymns.</p>
<p>Jane Borthwick died in 1897, and her younger sister followed
her ten years later.</p>

</div>
<div id="c52" title="Bonar, the Sweet Singer of Scotland">
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">[311]</div>
<h3>BONAR, THE SWEET SINGER OF SCOTLAND</h3>
<p>One of Scotland&rsquo;s most earnest soul-winners was also
its greatest hymnist. He was Horatius Bonar, a name
that will be forever cherished by all who are filled
with a fervent love for the Saviour and who find that love
so beautifully expressed in the spiritual songs of the noble
Scotchman.</p>
<p>Like the hymns of Mrs. Alexander, Dr. Bonar wrote his
songs for children; but they are so profound and intensely
spiritual in their very simplicity they will always satisfy the
most mature Christian mind. No matter how old we become,
our hearts will ever be stirred as we sing the tender
words:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I long to be like Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">Meek, loving, lowly, mild;</p>
<p class="t0">I long to be like Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">The Father&rsquo;s holy Child.</p>
<p class="t0">I long to be with Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">Amid the heavenly throng,</p>
<p class="t0">To sing with saints His praises,</p>
<p class="t">To learn the angels&rsquo; song.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The subjective, emotional element is strongly present in
the hymns of Bonar. In this respect there is a striking resemblance
to the hymns of the great German writer, Benjamin
Schmolck. Both use the name &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; freely, and both
become daringly intimate, yet the hymns of neither are weak
or sentimental.</p>
<p>In Bonar we behold the strange anomaly of a man with
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
a strong physique and powerful intellect combined with the
gentle, sympathetic nature of a woman and the simple, confiding
faith of a child. The warmth and sincerity of his
personal faith in Christ may be seen reflected in all his
hymns. &ldquo;I try to fill my hymns with the love and light of
Christ,&rdquo; he once said, and certainly he has drawn many souls
to the Saviour by the tenderness of their appeal.</p>
<p>Bonar is ever pointing in his hymns to Christ as an all-sufficient
Saviour, dwelling in simple language on the blessings
of the Atonement and the willingness of God to accept
all who come to Him through Christ. In these days of
modernistic teachings when practically all stress is placed on
&ldquo;living the Christ-life&rdquo; while the meritorious work of Christ
on behalf of the sinner is largely ignored and forgotten, it
would be salutary for the Church to listen anew to such
words as these:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Upon a Life I have not lived,</p>
<p class="t">Upon a Death I did not die,</p>
<p class="t0">Another&rsquo;s Life; Another&rsquo;s Death:</p>
<p class="t">I stake my whole eternity.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not on the tears which I have shed;</p>
<p class="t">Not on the sorrows I have known:</p>
<p class="t0">Another&rsquo;s tears; Another&rsquo;s griefs:</p>
<p class="t">On them I rest, on them alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, O Son of God, I build</p>
<p class="t">On what Thy cross has done for me;</p>
<p class="t0">There both my death and life I read;</p>
<p class="t">My guilt, my pardon there I see.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, I believe; O deal with me</p>
<p class="t">As one who has Thy Word believed!</p>
<p class="t0">I take the gift, Lord, look on me</p>
<p class="t">As one who has Thy gift received.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">[313]</div>
<p>Bonar was born in Edinburgh, December 19, 1808. His
father was a lawyer, but he came from a long line of eminent
Scottish ministers. His mother was a gentle, pious
woman, and it was largely through her influence that her
three sons, John, Horatius and Andrew, entered the ministry
of the Church of Scotland. Andrew became a noted
Bible commentator.</p>
<p>After completing his course at the University of Edinburgh,
Horatius began mission work in Leith, under Rev.
James Lewis. In one of the most squalid parts of the city
he conducted services and Sunday school in a hall. The children
did not seem to enjoy singing the Psalm paraphrases,
which were still exclusively used by the Church of Scotland
at that late date, and therefore Bonar decided to write songs
of his own. Like Luther, he chose happy tunes familiar to
the children, and wrote words to fit them. His first two
hymns were &ldquo;I lay my sins on Jesus&rdquo; and &ldquo;The morning,
the bright and beautiful morning.&rdquo; Still others were &ldquo;I
was a wandering sheep&rdquo; and &ldquo;A few more years shall roll.&rdquo;
Needless to say, the children sang and enjoyed them.</p>
<p>At this time, also, he wrote his first hymn for adults, &ldquo;Go,
labor on! Spend and be spent!&rdquo; It was intended to encourage
those who were working with him among the poor
of his district.</p>
<p>After four years Bonar was ordained as a minister of the
Church of Scotland, assuming charge of a new church at
Kelso. He was a man of prayer, and his first sermon to his
people was an exhortation to prayer. It is said that a young
servant in his home was converted by his prayers. Hearing
his earnest supplications from his locked study, she thought:
&ldquo;If he needs to pray so much, what will become of me, if
I do not pray!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">[314]</div>
<p>Many stories are related of his methods of dealing with
seeking souls. A young man who was troubled by a grievous
sin came to Bonar for help. The latter told him that God
was willing to forgive and that the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanseth from all sin. The despairing young man seemed
unable to believe the gospel message, however, and continually
reminded Bonar of the greatness of his transgression.
Finally an inspiration came to the pastor. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo;
he demanded, &ldquo;which is of greater weight in the eyes of
God&mdash;your sin, black as it is, or the blood of Jesus, shed
for sinners?&rdquo; Light dawned on the soul of the troubled
young man, and he cried joyfully, &ldquo;Oh, I am sure the blood
of Jesus weighs more heavily than even my sin!&rdquo; And so he
found peace.</p>
<p>Bonar was a man of boundless energy. When he was not
preaching, he was writing hymns or tracts or books. One
of his tracts, &ldquo;Believe and Live,&rdquo; was printed in more than
a million copies, and the late Queen Victoria of England
was much blessed by it. His hymns number about 600, and
the fact that at least 100 are in common use today is a testimonial
to their worth. Dr. Bonar never used his hymns in
his own church worship, but when, on a certain occasion
near the close of his life, he broke the rule, two of his elders
showed their emphatic disapproval by walking out of church.</p>
<p>Perhaps the finest hymn we have received from his pen,
if we except &ldquo;I lay my sins on Jesus,&rdquo; is &ldquo;I heard the voice
of Jesus say.&rdquo; Other familiar hymns are &ldquo;Thy works, not
mine, O Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;Not what my hands have done,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power,&rdquo; &ldquo;All that I was, my
sin, my guilt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thy way, not mine, O Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A few
more years shall roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1843 Dr. Bonar married Miss Jane Lundie, and for
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
forty years they shared joy and sorrow. She, too, was a
gifted writer, and it is she who has given us the beautiful
gem, &ldquo;Fade, fade, each earthly joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorrow was one of the means used by the Lord to enrich
and mellow the life of Bonar. Five of his children died
in early years. It required much of divine grace in such
experiences to write lines like these:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Spare not the stroke; do with us as Thou wilt;</p>
<p class="t">Let there be naught unfinished, broken, marred.</p>
<p class="t0">Complete Thy purpose, that we may become</p>
<p class="t">Thy perfect image, O our God and Lord.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bonar himself was sorely afflicted during the last two
years of his life. He died in 1889, deeply mourned by all
Scotland as well as by Christians throughout the world who
had come to know him through his tracts and hymns. At
his funeral one of his own hymns was sung. It was written
on the theme of his family motto, &ldquo;Heaven at Last.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c53" title="Two Famous Translators of Ancient Hymns">
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">[317]</div>
<h3>TWO FAMOUS TRANSLATORS OF ANCIENT HYMNS</h3>
<p>Little more than a century ago&mdash;in the year 1818,
to be exact&mdash;there was born in the great city of London
a child who was destined to become an unusual
scholar. He was christened John Mason Neale, a name that
may be found today throughout the pages of the world&rsquo;s
best hymn-books.</p>
<p>When he was only five years old, his father died, and,
like so many other men who have achieved fame, he received
the greater part of his elementary training from a gifted
mother.</p>
<p>At Cambridge University, which he entered at an early
age, he became a brilliant student, leading his classes and
winning numerous prizes. After his graduation he was ordained
as a minister in the Church of England.</p>
<p>His interest in the ancient hymns of the Christian Church
led him to spend much time in the morning lands of history,
particularly in Greece. To him, more than any one else,
we owe some of the most successful translations from the
classical languages. By his sojourn in eastern lands, he seems
to have been enabled to catch the spirit of the Greek hymns
to such a degree that his translations read almost like original
poems. For instance, in order to do justice to the famous
Easter hymn of John of Damascus, written some time during
the eighth century, Neale celebrated Easter in Athens
and heard the &ldquo;glorious old hymn of victory,&rdquo; as he called it,
sung by a great throng of worshipers at midnight. The result
is his sublime translation:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">[318]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The day of resurrection!</p>
<p class="t">Earth, tell it out abroad!</p>
<p class="t0">The Passover of gladness,</p>
<p class="t">The Passover of God!</p>
<p class="t0">From death to Life eternal,</p>
<p class="t">From earth unto the sky,</p>
<p class="t0">Our Christ hath brought us over,</p>
<p class="t">With hymns of victory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another very famous translation from the Greek by Neale
is the hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Art thou weary, art thou languid,</p>
<p class="t">Art thou sore distressed?</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come to me,&rdquo; saith One, &ldquo;and, coming,</p>
<p class="t">Be at rest.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This hymn is often regarded as an original by Neale, but
the author was St. Stephen the Sabaite, a monk who received
his name from the monastery in which he spent his life, that
of St. Sabas, near Bethlehem, overlooking the Dead Sea. St.
Stephen, who was born in 725 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, had been placed in the
monastery at the age of ten years by his uncle. He lived
there more than half a century until his death in 794 <span class="small">A.D.</span></p>
<p>Neale was equally successful in the translation of ancient
Latin hymns. Perhaps the most notable is his rendering of
Bernard of Cluny&rsquo;s immortal hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jerusalem, the golden,</p>
<p class="t">With milk and honey blest!</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath thy contemplation</p>
<p class="t">Sink heart and voice oppressed:</p>
<p class="t0">I know not, O I know not,</p>
<p class="t">What blissful joys are there,</p>
<p class="t0">What radiancy of glory,</p>
<p class="t">What light beyond compare!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So facile was Neale in the art of writing either English
or Latin verse, that he often astounded his friends. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
said that on one occasion John Keble, author of &ldquo;The Christian
Year,&rdquo; was visiting him. Absenting himself from the
room for a few minutes, Neale returned shortly and exclaimed:
&ldquo;I thought, Keble, that all your poems in &lsquo;The
Christian Year&rsquo; were original; but one of them, at least,
seems to be a translation.&rdquo; Thereupon he handed Keble, to
the latter&rsquo;s amazement, a very fine Latin rendering of one of
Keble&rsquo;s own poems. He had made the translation during his
absence from the room.</p>
<p>But Neale did not confine himself to translations. He also
wrote a large number of splendid original hymns. He was
fond of writing hymns for holy days and festivals of the
church year. The hymn printed in connection with this
sketch is for Advent. &ldquo;Oh Thou, who by a star didst guide,&rdquo;
for Epiphany, and &ldquo;Blessed Saviour, who hast taught me,&rdquo;
for confirmation, are among his other original hymns.</p>
<p>Because of his &ldquo;high church&rdquo; tendencies, accentuated no
doubt by the influence of the &ldquo;Oxford Movement,&rdquo; Neale
incurred the suspicion of some that he leaned toward the
Church of Rome. However, there is nothing of Roman
error to be found in his hymns. The evangelical note rings
pure and clear, and for this reason they will no doubt continue
to be loved and sung through centuries yet to come.</p>
<p>Neale died August 6, 1866, at the age of forty-eight years,
trusting in the atoning blood of Christ, and with the glorious
assurance expressed in his version of St. Stephen&rsquo;s hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If I still hold closely to Him,</p>
<p class="t">What hath He at last?</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sorrow vanquished, labor ended,</p>
<p class="t">Jordan passed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If I ask Him to receive me,</p>
<p class="t">Will He say me nay?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">[320]</div>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Not till earth and not till heaven</p>
<p class="t">Pass away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another Englishman who gained renown by translations
of the old classical hymns of the Church was Edward Caswall.
He was a contemporary of Neale, and, like the latter,
came under the influence of the &ldquo;Oxford Movement,&rdquo;
which cost the Church of England some of its ablest men.
While Neale, however, remained faithful to his own communion,
Caswall resigned as a minister of the English
Church and became a Romanist. He was made a priest in
the Congregation of the Oratory, which Cardinal Newman
had established in Birmingham, a position he continued to
fill until his death in 1878.</p>
<p>Two of the most beautiful hymns in the English
language&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus, the very thought of Thee&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Jesus, King
most wonderful&rdquo;&mdash;were derived by Caswall from the famous
Latin poem, <i>De Nomine Jesu</i>, by Bernard of Clairvaux.
Of the former hymn Dr. Robinson has said: &ldquo;One might
call this poem the finest in the world and still be
within the limits of all extravagance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among other fine translations from the Latin by Caswall
are &ldquo;Hark! a thrilling voice is sounding&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glory be to
Jesus.&rdquo; He also has given us some hymns from the German,
including the exquisite morning hymn, &ldquo;When morning gilds
the skies.&rdquo; This is such a free rendering, however, that it
may rather be regarded as an original hymn by Caswall.
Three of its stanzas read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When morning gilds the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">My heart, awaking, cries,</p>
<p class="t">May Jesus Christ be praised!</p>

<p class="t0">To Jesus I repair;</p>
<p class="t">May Jesus Christ be praised!</p>

<p class="t0">Let air, and sea, and sky</p>
<p class="t0">From depth to height reply,</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Sabine Baring-Gould</span>, 1865.</p>
</div>
<div id="c54" title="Baring-Gould and His Noted Hymn">
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">[323]</div>
<h3>BARING-GOULD AND HIS NOTED HYMN</h3>
<p>When Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould, on Whitsunday,
1865, sat up a greater portion of the night to compose
a hymn, he did not realize he was writing words
that would be sung through the centuries; but that no doubt
will be the result of his zeal. The hymn he wrote was &ldquo;Onward,
Christian soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story is an interesting one. At that time Baring-Gould
was minister of the Established Church at Lew-Trenchard,
England. On Whitmonday the children of his village
were to march to an adjoining village for a Sunday
school rally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only there was something they could sing as they
marched,&rdquo; the pastor thought, &ldquo;the way would not seem so
long.&rdquo; He searched diligently for something suitable but
failed to find what he wanted. Finally he decided to write
a marching song. It took the greater part of the night to do
it, but the next morning the children&rsquo;s pilgrimage was made
the lighter and happier by &ldquo;Onward, Christian soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on the hymn some thirty years later, the author
said: &ldquo;It was written in great haste, and I am afraid
some of the rhymes are faulty. Certainly, nothing has surprised
me more than its popularity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this instance, as in many others that might be mentioned,
the tune to which it is inseparably wedded, has no
doubt contributed much to make it popular. Sir Arthur
Seymour Sullivan, the great English organist who wrote
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
&ldquo;The Lost Chord,&rdquo; in 1872 composed the stirring music now
used for Baring-Gould&rsquo;s hymn.</p>
<p>Objection has sometimes been voiced against the hymn because
of its martial spirit. However, it should be noted that
this hymn gives not the slightest hint of warfare with carnal
weapons. The allusion is to spiritual warfare, and the warrior
is the Christian soldier.</p>
<p>We are reminded throughout this hymn of Paul&rsquo;s martial
imagery in the sixth chapter of Ephesians, where he tells us
that &ldquo;our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against
the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers
of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness
in the heavenly places,&rdquo; and admonishes us to put on
&ldquo;the whole armor of God.&rdquo; We also recall the same apostle&rsquo;s
exhortation to Timothy to &ldquo;war the good warfare,&rdquo; and to
&ldquo;fight the good fight of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is salutary to be reminded by such a hymn as this of
the heroic character of the Christian life. The follower of
Jesus is not to sit with folded hands and sing his way into
Paradise. A sickly, sentimental religion has no more place
in the Christian Church today than it had in those early
days when apostles and martyrs sealed their faith with their
life-blood. Baring-Gould&rsquo;s hymn seems almost an exultant
answer to Isaac Watts&rsquo; challenging stanza:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Must I be carried to the skies</p>
<p class="t">On flowery beds of ease,</p>
<p class="t0">While others fought to win the prize,</p>
<p class="t">And sailed through bloody seas?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We sometimes hear it said that the Church of Christ has
fallen on evil days, and more than one faithful soul fears for
the future. Baring-Gould has reminded us here of Christ&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
&ldquo;own promise&rdquo; that, though kingdoms may rise and fall,
His kingdom shall ever remain, for the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it.</p>
<p>During a desperate battle between the French and Austrians
in the Napoleonic wars, a French officer rushed to his
commander and exclaimed, &ldquo;The battle is lost!&rdquo; Quietly
the general answered, &ldquo;One battle is lost, but there is time
to win another.&rdquo; Inspired by the commander&rsquo;s unconquerable
optimism, the French army renewed the struggle and
snatched victory out of the jaws of defeat. That has ever
been the history of the Church of Christ.</p>
<p>Baring-Gould was one of England&rsquo;s most versatile ministers.
In addition to his hymn-writing, he was a novelist
of considerable reputation. For many years he regularly
produced a novel every year. His &ldquo;Lives of the Saints&rdquo;
in fifteen volumes, his &ldquo;Curious Myths of the Middle Ages&rdquo;
and his &ldquo;Legends of the Old Testament&rdquo; are all notable
works. It is said that he did all his writing in long hand
without the aid of a secretary. He once declared that he
often did his best work when he felt least inclined to apply
himself to his task. He never waited for an &ldquo;inspiration,&rdquo;
but plunged into his work and then stuck to it until it was
finished.</p>
<p>The beautiful evening hymn, &ldquo;Now the day is over,&rdquo; is
also from Baring-Gould&rsquo;s pen, and, to show his versatility,
he also composed the tune for it. He was also the translator
of Bernhardt Severin Ingemann&rsquo;s famous Danish
hymn, &ldquo;Through the night of doubt and sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite his arduous and unceasing labors, Baring-Gould
lived to the ripe old age of ninety years. He died in 1924,
but his hymn goes marching on.</p>

<h3>FRANCES RIDLEY HAVERGAL, THE CONSECRATION POET</h3>
<p>The beauty of a consecrated Christian life has probably
never been more perfectly revealed than in the
life of Frances Ridley Havergal. To read the story
of her life is not only an inspiration, but it discloses at once
the secret of her beautiful hymns. She lived her hymns before
she wrote them.</p>
<p>This sweetest of all English singers was born at Astley,
Worcestershire, December 14, 1836. She was such a bright,
happy and vivacious child that her father, who was a minister
of the Church of England and himself a hymn-writer
of no mean ability, called her &ldquo;Little Quicksilver.&rdquo; Her
father was also a gifted musician, and this quality too was
inherited by the daughter, who became a brilliant pianist and
passionately fond of singing. However, because she looked
upon her talents as gifts from God to be used only in His
service, she would sing nothing but sacred songs.</p>
<p>Her sunshiny nature became even more radiant following
a deep religious experience at the age of fourteen. Of
this she afterwards wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I committed my soul to the Saviour, and earth and heaven
seemed brighter from that moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen she was confirmed. It is evident
that she looked upon her confirmation as one of the most
blessed experiences of her life, for when she returned home
she wrote in her manuscript book of poems:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_328">[328]</div>
<h4>&ldquo;THINE FOR EVER&rdquo;</h4>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh! Thine for ever, what a blessed thing</p>
<p class="t">To be for ever His who died for me!</p>
<p class="t0">My Saviour, all my life Thy praise I&rsquo;ll sing,</p>
<p class="t">Nor cease my song throughout eternity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She also wrote a hymn on Confirmation, &ldquo;In full and glad
surrender.&rdquo; This hymn her sister declared was &ldquo;the epitome
of her life and the focus of its sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four years later, while pursuing studies in D&uuml;sseldorf,
Germany, Miss Havergal chanced to see Sternberg&rsquo;s celebrated
painting, <i>Ecce Homo</i>, with the inscription beneath it:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This have I done for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">What hast thou done for me?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was the same painting that once made such a profound
impression on the youthful mind of Count Zinzendorf. Miss
Havergal was likewise deeply moved, and immediately she
seized a piece of scrap paper and a pencil and wrote the famous
hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I gave My life for thee,</p>
<p class="t">My precious blood I shed,</p>
<p class="t0">That thou might&rsquo;st ransomed be,</p>
<p class="t">And quickened from the dead.</p>
<p class="t0">I gave My life for thee:</p>
<p class="t0">What hast thou given for Me?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She thought the verses so poor after she had read them
over that she tossed them into a stove. The piece of paper,
however, fell out untouched by the flames. When she
showed the words to her father a few months later, he was
so touched by them he immediately composed a tune by
which they could be sung.</p>
<p>This seems to have been one of the great turning points
in the life of the young hymnist. Her hymns from this period
reveal her as a fully surrendered soul, her one ambition
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
being to devote all her talents to Christ. She did not consider
herself to be a poet of a high order, but so filled was
she with the love of Christ that her heart overflowed with
rapturous praise. Indeed, her hymns may be said to be the
record of her own spiritual experiences. Always she was
proclaiming the evangel of full and free salvation through
Jesus&rsquo; merits to all who believe.</p>
<p>She is often referred to as &ldquo;the consecration poet.&rdquo; This
is an allusion to her famous consecration hymn, written in
1874:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Take my life, and let it be</p>
<p class="t0">Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Take my moments and my days;</p>
<p class="t0">Let them flow in ceaseless praise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The circumstances that led to the writing of this hymn
are interesting. Miss Havergal was spending a few days
in a home where there were ten persons, some of them unconverted,
and the others rather half-hearted Christians who
seemed to derive no joy from their religion. A great desire
came upon her that she might be instrumental in bringing
them all to true faith in Christ. Her prayer was wonderfully
answered, and on the last night of her stay her heart
was so filled with joy and gratitude she could not sleep. Instead,
she spent the night writing the consecration hymn.</p>
<p>Her prayer, &ldquo;Take my silver and my gold; not a mite
would I withhold,&rdquo; was not an idle petition with her. In
August, 1878, she wrote to a friend: &ldquo;The Lord has shown
me another little step, and of course I have taken it, with extreme
delight. &lsquo;Take my silver and my gold,&rsquo; now means
shipping off all my ornaments to the Church Missionary
House (including a jewel cabinet that is really fit for a
countess), where all will be accepted and disposed of for me.
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
I retain a brooch or two for daily wear, which are memorials
of my dear parents, also a locket containing a portrait of my
dear niece in heaven, my Evelyn, and her two rings; but
these I redeem, so that the whole value goes to the Church
Missionary Society. Nearly fifty articles are being packed
up. I don&rsquo;t think I ever packed a box with such pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to her other accomplishments, Miss Havergal
was a brilliant linguist, having mastered a number of modern
languages. She was also proficient in Greek and Hebrew.
Her sister records that she always had her Hebrew Bible
and Greek New Testament at hand when she read the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The study of the Bible was one of her chief joys. During
summer she began her Bible reading at seven in the
morning, and in winter at eight o&rsquo;clock. When, on cold
days, her sister would beg her to sit near the fire, she would
answer: &ldquo;But then, Marie, I can&rsquo;t rule my lines neatly.
Just see what a find I&rsquo;ve got. If one only searches, there
are such extraordinary things in the Bible!&rdquo; Her Bible
was freely underscored and filled with notations. She was
able to repeat from memory the four Gospels, the Epistles,
Revelation and all the Psalms, and in later years she added
Isaiah and the Minor Prophets to the list.</p>
<p>Miss Havergal was only forty-two at the time of her
death, on June 3, 1879. When her attending physician told
her that her condition was serious, she replied, &ldquo;If I am
really going, it is too good to be true!&rdquo; At the bottom of
her bed she had her favorite text placed where she could see
it: &ldquo;The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from
all sin.&rdquo; She also asked that these words be inscribed upon
her coffin and on her tombstone. Once she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Splendid! To be so near the gates of heaven!&rdquo; And again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
&ldquo;So beautiful to go! So beautiful to go!&rdquo; She died while
singing:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, I will trust Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Trust Thee with my soul;</p>
<p class="t0">Guilty, lost, and helpless,</p>
<p class="t">Thou hast made me whole:</p>
<p class="t0">There is none in heaven</p>
<p class="t">Or on earth like Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou hast died for sinners,</p>
<p class="t">Therefore, Lord, for me!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some of the more popular hymns by Miss Havergal, aside
from those already mentioned, are: &ldquo;O Saviour, precious
Saviour,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou art
coming, O my Saviour,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, speak to me, that I may
speak,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Singing for Jesus, our Saviour and King.&rdquo;
While she was writing the hymns that were destined to
make her famous, another remarkable young woman, &ldquo;Fanny&rdquo;
Crosby, America&rsquo;s blind hymn-writer, was also achieving
renown by her hymns and songs. Miss Havergal and
Miss Crosby never met, but each was an ardent admirer of
the other, and on one occasion the English poet sent a very
touching greeting to the American hymn-writer. It read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dear blind sister over the sea,</p>
<p class="t0">An English heart goes forth to thee.</p>
<p class="t0">We are linked by a cable of faith and song,</p>
<p class="t0">Flashing bright sympathy swift along:</p>
<p class="t0">One in the East and one in the West</p>
<p class="t0">Singing for Him whom our souls love best;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Singing for Jesus,&rdquo; telling His love</p>
<p class="t0">All the way to our home above,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the severing sea, with its restless tide,</p>
<p class="t0">Never shall hinder and never divide.</p>
<p class="t0">Sister! What shall our meeting be,</p>
<p class="t0">When our hearts shall sing, and our eyes shall see!</p>

</div>
<div id="c56" title="A Unitarian Who Gloried in the Cross">
<div class="pb" id="Page_333">[333]</div>
<h3>A UNITARIAN WHO GLORIED IN THE CROSS</h3>
<p>Among the great hymns of the cross, Sir John Bowring&rsquo;s
classic, &ldquo;In the cross of Christ I glory,&rdquo; occupies
a foremost place. This is all the more remarkable
when we are reminded that Bowring was known as a
Unitarian, a communion which not only denies the deity of
Christ, but ignores the true significance of the cross. And
yet he has given us a hymn that every evangelical Christian
rejoices to sing, for it is a hymn that magnifies the cross and
makes it the very center of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>In justice to Bowring it ought to be stated that he himself
was &ldquo;a devoted and evangelical believer,&rdquo; and that his connection
with the Unitarian Church was merely accidental
and nominal. When he died, in 1872, the opening line of
his famous hymn was inscribed in bold letters upon his
tombstone:</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">In the Cross of Christ I Glory</span></p>
<p>Knowing these things, every true Christian will cherish
an inner conviction that the man who wrote so beautiful a
tribute to Christ and the cross did not really die but only
fell asleep, trusting in the atoning death of a Saviour who
is God.</p>
<p>Bowring was a learned man, especially famed as a linguist.
He is said to have been able to speak twenty-two languages
fluently, and was able to converse in at least one hundred
different tongues. He found special delight in translating
poems from other languages. His published works contain
translations from Bohemian, Slavonic, Russian, Servian,
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Polish, Slovakian, Illyrian, Teutonic, Esthonian, Dutch,
Frisian, Lettish, Finnish, Hungarian, Biscayan, French,
Provencal, Gascon, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalonian
and Galician sources.</p>
<p>Sir John was particularly fond of the study of hymns.
Even at the age of eighty years he was said to begin the day
with some new song of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>In addition to all his other accomplishments, Bowring had
a very distinguished career in English politics. He was
twice a member of the British parliament. Later he became
consul general for the English government at Hong Kong,
China. During this period he chanced to sail down the Chinese
coast to Macao, where nearly 400 years earlier the Portuguese
explorer, Vasco da Gama, had built an imposing
cathedral. The structure had been wrecked by a typhoon,
but the tower still remained, and surmounting it a great
bronze cross, sharply outlined against the sky. Far above
the wreckage surrounding it, the cross seemed to Bowring
to be a symbol of Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom, glorious and eternal,
living through the centuries while other kingdoms have come
and gone. So inspired was he by the sight, the words of the
hymn seemed to suggest themselves to him at once, and in a
short while a famous poem had been written.</p>
<p>The plan of the hymn is interesting. The first stanza declares
the cross of Christ to be the central fact in divine
revelation and the one theme in which the Christian never
ceases to glory. The second stanza pictures the cross as
the Christian&rsquo;s refuge and comfort in time of affliction, while
the third tells how it also adds luster to the days of joy and
sunshine. The final stanza summarizes these two ideas, and
the hymn closes by telling of the eternal character of the
peace and joy that flow from the cross.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">[335]</div>
<p>An interesting story is told of this hymn in connection
with the Boxer uprising in China. All foreigners in Peking
had been besieged by the infuriated Chinese for several
weeks. When the allied troops finally reached the city and
the terrible strain was ended, the Christian missionaries gathered
in the Temple of Heaven, the remarkable pagan shrine
where the Emperor of China was accustomed to worship,
and, lifting up their voices in thanksgiving, the messengers
of the cross sang:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the cross of Christ I glory,</p>
<p class="t">Towering o&rsquo;er the wrecks of time;</p>
<p class="t0">All the light of sacred story</p>
<p class="t">Gathers round its head sublime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sir John Bowring eventually became governor of Hong
Kong, and wielded great influence in the Orient. He did
much to promote Christian benevolences and other enterprises
for the good of the peoples in the Far East. When
his health began to fail, his friends warned him to cease
some of his activities, but in vain. His answer was, &ldquo;I must
do my work while life remains to me; I may not long be
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was often gratified to hear his hymns sung at unexpected
times and in unusual places. In 1825 he wrote a poem
beginning with the words, &ldquo;Watchman, tell us of the night.&rdquo;
He did not know it was being used as a hymn until ten
years later, when he heard it sung by Christian missionaries
in Turkey. Among other hymns of Bowring that have come
into general use is the beautiful one beginning with the
words:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God is Love; His mercy brightens</p>
<p class="t">All the path in which we rove;</p>
<p class="t0">Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens:</p>
<p class="t">God is Wisdom, God is Love.</p>

<div id="c57" title="A Model Hymn by a Model Minister">
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">[337]</div>
<h3>A MODEL HYMN BY A MODEL MINISTER</h3>
<p>It is a significant fact that many of the greatest hymns
of the Church have been written by pastors who have
been noted for their zeal in winning souls. Their
hymns have been a part of their spiritual stratagem to draw
the wayward and erring into the gospel net. Bishop William
Walsham How, one of the more recent hymnists of
England, is a shining example of true devotion in a Christian
shepherd.</p>
<p>Bishop How once gave a striking description of the characteristics
which he believed should be found in an ideal minister
of the gospel. &ldquo;Such a minister,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should be a
man pure, holy, and spotless in his life; a man of much
prayer; in character meek, lowly, and infinitely compassionate;
of tenderest love to all; full of sympathy for every
pain and sorrow, and devoting his days and nights to lightening
the burdens of humanity; utterly patient of insult and
enmity; utterly fearless in speaking the truth and rebuking
sin; ever ready to answer every call, to go wherever bidden,
in order to do good; wholly without thought of self; making
himself the servant of all; patient, gentle, and untiring in
dealing with the souls he would save; bearing with ignorance,
wilfulness, slowness, cowardice, in those of whom
he expects most; sacrificing all, even life itself, if need be,
to save some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who knew How best said it was almost a perfect
description of his own life and character.</p>
<p>When Queen Victoria, in 1879, made him Bishop of Bedford,
with East London as his diocese, he was tireless in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
efforts to alleviate conditions in that poverty-stricken district.
When he first began his work in the slums, people would
point to him and say, &ldquo;There goes a bishop.&rdquo; But as they
came to know him better, they said, &ldquo;There goes <i>the</i> bishop.&rdquo;
And finally, when they learned to love him, they exclaimed,
&ldquo;There goes <i>our</i> bishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop How&rsquo;s most celebrated hymn is &ldquo;O Jesus, Thou
art standing.&rdquo; It is based on the impressive words of the
Saviour in the Book of Revelation, &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the
door, and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the
door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the language of the hymn is commonplace, there
are striking expressions here, as in How&rsquo;s other hymns, that
arrest the attention of the worshiper. In the first stanza we
are reminded that there are many nominal Christians bearing
&ldquo;His Name and sign&rdquo; who yet are keeping the waiting,
patient Saviour outside a &ldquo;fast-closed door.&rdquo; In the succeeding
verse we are told that it is sin that bars the gate.
Then there is the concluding stanza with its gripping appeal,
picturing the surrender of the human heart to the
pleading Christ.</p>
<p>The imagery in the hymn was, no doubt, suggested by
Holman Hunt&rsquo;s celebrated painting, &ldquo;The Light of the
World.&rdquo; This was executed by Hunt in 1855, while the
hymn by How was written twelve years later. Those who
are familiar with the Hunt masterpiece will remember how
it pictures the Saviour standing patiently and knocking earnestly
at a fast-closed door. The high weeds, the tangled
growth of vines, as well as the unpicked fruit lying on the
ground before the door, suggest that it has not been opened
for a long time. A bat is hovering in the vines overhead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">[339]</div>
<p>Ruskin tells us that the white robe worn by the heavenly
Stranger shows us that He is a Prophet, the jeweled robe
and breastplate indicate a Priest, and the crown of gold a
King. The crown of thorns is now bearing leaves &ldquo;for the
healing of the nations.&rdquo; In His scarred hand He carries a
lighted lantern, signifying &ldquo;the Light of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Holman Hunt&rsquo;s picture was first exhibited, it excited
considerable comment. Some one, however, ventured
the criticism that there was a fault in the painting inasmuch
as Hunt had forgotten to indicate a latch on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no mistake,&rdquo; said the great artist. &ldquo;I did not
put a latch on the outside of the door because it can only be
opened from within. The Lord Jesus Christ Himself cannot
enter an unwilling heart; it must be opened to Him. He
must be invited to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop How&rsquo;s hymn pictures in language what Holman
Hunt put into his celebrated canvass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Jesus, Thou art standing&rdquo; is not the only famous
hymn written by Bishop How. His lovely New Year&rsquo;s
hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, Name of wondrous love,&rdquo; and his All Saints&rsquo;
hymn, &ldquo;For all the saints who from their labors rest,&rdquo; have
won a place forever in English hymnody. &ldquo;O Word of God
Incarnate,&rdquo; &ldquo;We give Thee but Thine own&rdquo; and &ldquo;Summer
suns are glowing&rdquo; also have found their way into a large
number of the standard hymn-books.</p>
<p>The talented bishop died in the year 1897, mourned not
only by those who had learned to love him because of his
noble Christian character, but also by those who had come
to know him through his beautiful hymns. With the passing
of only three decades since his death, there is increasing
evidence that Bishop How will be numbered among the great
hymn-writers of the Christian Church.</p>

<div id="c58" title="Matheson and His Song in the Night">
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">[341]</div>
<h3>MATHESON AND HIS SONG IN THE NIGHT</h3>
<p>The most recent of English hymn-writers to gain recognition
in the standard hymn-books of the Church
is George Matheson. The fame of this man will
probably rest on a single hymn, &ldquo;O Love that wilt not let
me go,&rdquo; written on a summer evening in 1882.</p>
<p>A deeper appreciation and understanding will be felt for
this hymn when we know that it is truly a &ldquo;song in the
night,&rdquo; for Matheson was blind when he wrote it.</p>
<p>Born in Glasgow, Scotland, March 27, 1842, Matheson
enjoyed partial vision as a boy. However, after he entered
Glasgow University at the age of fifteen, his sight began to
fail and he became totally blind. Nevertheless, in spite of
this handicap, he was a brilliant scholar and graduated with
honor in 1861. Having decided to enter the ministry, he
remained four additional years for theological studies.</p>
<p>It was while he was parish minister at Innellan, a seaport
summer resort in Scotland, that the famous hymn was written.
He tells the story in his own words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was written in the manse of my former parish (Innellan)
one summer evening in 1882. It was composed with
extreme rapidity; it seemed to me that its construction occupied
only a few minutes, and I felt myself rather in the
position of one who was being dictated to than an original
artist. I was suffering from extreme mental distress, and
the hymn was the fruit of pain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">[342]</div>
<p>Many conjectures have been made regarding the cause
of the &ldquo;mental distress&rdquo; from which the author was suffering.
Because of the opening line, &ldquo;O Love that wilt not let
me go,&rdquo; it has been suggested that Matheson had been bitterly
disappointed in his hopes of marrying a young woman
to whom he had become deeply attached. It is said that her
refusal to marry him was due to his blindness.</p>
<p>Although this story cannot be vouched for, there are many
significant hints in the hymn to his sad affliction, such as the
&ldquo;flickering torch&rdquo; and the &ldquo;borrowed ray&rdquo; in the second
stanza, the beautiful thought of tracing &ldquo;the rainbow
through the rain&rdquo; in the third stanza, and the &ldquo;cross&rdquo; referred
to in the final stanza. The hymn is so artistically
constructed and is so rich in poetic thought and symbolic
meaning, it will well repay careful study.</p>
<p>Despite his handicap, Dr. Matheson was blessed with a
fruitful ministry. A devoted sister who had learned Greek,
Latin and Hebrew in order to aid him in his theological
studies remained his co-worker and helper throughout life.
In all of his pastoral calls she was his constant guide.</p>
<p>During the early part of his ministry, he wrote all his
sermons in full. He possessed such a remarkable memory
that after a sermon had been read to him twice, he was able
to repeat it perfectly. After he had followed this practice
for twelve years, he suffered a complete collapse of memory
one Sunday in the midst of a sermon. Unable to proceed,
he calmly announced a hymn and sat down. At the
conclusion of the singing he told the congregation what had
happened, and then preached a sermon of great appeal from
another text.</p>
<p>After a ministry at Innellan lasting for eighteen years, he
was called as pastor of St. Bernard&rsquo;s church in Edinburgh.
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
Here he remained for thirteen years, attracting large multitudes
by his preaching.</p>
<p>The later years of his life were spent in literary work.
He was the author of several volumes in prose, among
them a very fine devotional book called &ldquo;Moments on the
Mount.&rdquo; He fell asleep August 28, 1906, to await the
break of eternity&rsquo;s dawn, confident in the assurance that</p>

<div id="c59" title="The Beginnings of Hymnody in America">
<div class="pb" id="Page_347">[347]</div>
<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF HYMNODY IN AMERICA</h3>
<p>The rise of hymnody in America ran parallel with
the development of hymn-singing in England. The
Puritans who came from Holland in the Mayflower
in 1620 were &ldquo;separatists&rdquo; from the Church of England,
hence they used a psalm-book of their own, published by
Henry Ainsworth at Amsterdam in 1612. This was the
book that cheered their souls on the perilous crossing of the
Atlantic and during the hard and trying years that followed
their landing at Plymouth.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Amid the storm they sang,</p>
<p class="t">And the stars heard and the sea;</p>
<p class="t0">And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang</p>
<p class="t">With the anthems of the free.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was also the book that comforted Priscilla, when
John Alden stole in and found that</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The later Puritans who came directly from England, on
the other hand, were not &ldquo;separatists,&rdquo; hence they brought
with them the psalm-book of Sternhold and Hopkins, which
was the version of the Psaltery approved at that time by
the Established Church.</p>
<p>The wretched paraphrases of the Psalms in both the Ainsworth
and the &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; version of Sternhold and Hopkins
eventually led to an insistent demand among the New England
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
Puritans for an entirely new psalm-book which should
also adhere more closely to the Hebrew original. The result
was the famous &ldquo;Bay Psalmist&rdquo; of 1640, which was
the first book printed in British America.</p>
<p>The Puritan editors of this first attempt at American
psalmody cared no more for poetic effect than did their
brother versifiers across the waters. This they made quite
plain in the concluding words of the Preface to the &ldquo;Bay
Psalmist&rdquo;: &ldquo;If therefore the verses are not always so smooth
and elegant as some may desire or expect; let them consider
that God&rsquo;s Altar needs not our pollishings: Ex. 20, for wee
have respected rather a plaine translation, than to smooth
our verses with the sweetness of any paraphrase, and soe have
attended to Conscience rather than Elegance, fidelity rather
than poetry, in translating the hebrew words into english language,
and David&rsquo;s poetry into english meetre: that soe wee
may sing in Sion the Lords songs of praise according to his
own will; untill hee take us from hence, and wipe away
all our tears, &amp; bid us enter into our masters joye to sing
eternall Halleluiahs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editors scarcely needed to apprise the worshiper that
he should not look for artistic verses, for a glimpse within
its pages was sufficient to disillusion any one who expected
to find sacred poetry. The metrical form given the 137th
Psalm is an example of the Puritan theologians&rsquo; contempt
for polished language:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The rivers on of Babilon</p>
<p class="t">there when wee did sit downe:</p>
<p class="t">yea even then wee mourned, when</p>
<p class="t">wee remembred Sion.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Our Harps wee did hang it amid,</p>
<p class="t">upon the willow tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_349">[349]</div>
<p class="t">Because there they that us away</p>
<p class="t">led in captivitee,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Required of us a song, &amp; thus</p>
<p class="t">askt mirth: us waste who laid,</p>
<p class="t">sing us among a Sions song,</p>
<p class="t">unto us then they said.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The lords song sing can wee? being</p>
<p class="t">in strangers land. Then let</p>
<p class="t">loose her skill my right hand, if I</p>
<p class="t">Jerusalem forget.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let cleave my tongue my pallate on,</p>
<p class="t">if minde thee doe not I:</p>
<p class="t">if chiefe joyes o&rsquo;er I prize not more</p>
<p class="t">Jerusalem my joye.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nevertheless, strange as it may seem, the &ldquo;Bay Psalmist&rdquo;
passed through twenty-seven editions, and was even reprinted
several times abroad, being used extensively in England and
Scotland. Gradually, however, psalmody began to lose its
hold on the Reformed churches, both in Europe and America,
and hymnody gained the ascendancy. The publication in
1707 of the epoch-making work of Isaac Watts, &ldquo;Hymns and
Spiritual Songs,&rdquo; was the first step in breaking down the
prejudice in the Calvinistic churches against &ldquo;hymns of human
composure.&rdquo; In America the Great Awakening under
Jonathan Edwards, which began in 1734 and which received
added impetus from the visit of John Whitefield in 1740,
also brought about a demand for a happier form of congregational
singing. Then came the influence of the Wesleyan
revival with its glorious outburst of song.</p>
<p>Jonathan Edwards himself, stern Puritan that he was,
was finally forced to confess that it was &ldquo;really needful that
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
we should have some other songs than the Psalms of David.&rdquo;
Accordingly hymn singing grew rapidly in favor among the
people.</p>
<p>The first attempt to introduce hymns in the authorized
psalm-books was made by Joel Barlow, a chaplain in the
Revolutionary War. Instructed by the General Association
of Congregational Churches of Connecticut to revise Watts&rsquo;
&ldquo;Psalms of David&rdquo; in order to purge them of their British
flavor, he was likewise authorized to append to the Psalms
a collection of hymns. He made a selection of seventy
hymns, and the new book was published in 1786.</p>
<p>It was received with delight by the Presbyterians, but the
Congregationalists who had sponsored it were thoroughly
dissatisfied. As an example of the morbid character of
Puritan theology, Edward S. Ninde has called attention to
the fact that while Barlow failed to include Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jesus,
Lover of my soul&rdquo; or Watts&rsquo; &ldquo;When I survey the wondrous
cross,&rdquo; he did select such a hymn by Watts as &ldquo;Hark, from
the tombs, a doleful sound,&rdquo; and another beginning with the
lines,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My thoughts on awful subjects roll,</p>
<p class="t">Damnation and the dead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A second attempt to make a complete revision of Watts&rsquo;
&ldquo;Psalms of David&rdquo; was decided upon by the Congregational
churches, and this time the task was entrusted to Timothy
Dwight, president of Yale College. Dwight, who was a
grandson of Jonathan Edwards, was born in 1752. He entered
Yale at the age of thirteen and graduated with highest
honors in 1769. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War
he was commissioned a chaplain and throughout the conflict
he wrote songs to enthuse the American troops. In 1795
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
he was elected president of Yale College, in which position
he served his Alma Mater for twenty years.</p>
<p>Dwight exhibited a spirit of bold independence when he
added to the revised &ldquo;Psalms&rdquo; by Watts a collection of two
hundred and sixty-three hymns. Of these hymns, one hundred
and sixty-eight were also by Watts, indicating the hold
which that great hymnist retained on the English-speaking
world. Other hymn-writers represented in Dwight&rsquo;s book
included Stennett, Doddridge, Cowper, Newton, Toplady,
and Charles Wesley. Only one of the latter&rsquo;s hymns was
chosen, however, and Toplady&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; was not
included!</p>
<p>Dwight himself wrote thirty-three paraphrases of the
Psalms, but they were so freely rendered that they are
properly classified as original hymns. Among these is his
splendid version of the 137th Psalm, &ldquo;I love Thy Zion,
Lord,&rdquo; which may be regarded as the earliest hymn of American
origin still in common use today. It is usually dated
1800, which is the year when Dwight&rsquo;s work was published.</p>
<p>Dwight, who will always be remembered as the outstanding
figure in the beginnings of American hymnody, died
in 1817. The story of his life is an inspiring one, illustrating
how his heroic qualities conquered despite a &ldquo;thorn in
the flesh.&rdquo; A chronicler records that &ldquo;during the greater
part of forty years he was not able to read fifteen minutes
in the twenty-four hours; and often, for days and weeks
together, the pain which he endured in that part of the head
immediately behind the eyes amounted to anguish.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c60" title="America&rsquo;s First Woman Hymnist">
<div class="pb" id="Page_353">[353]</div>
<h3>AMERICA&rsquo;S FIRST WOMAN HYMNIST</h3>
<p>Less than twenty years after Timothy Dwight&rsquo;s
hymns were published, a very poor and unpretentious
American woman began to write lyrics that have been
treasured by the Church until this present day, nor will they
soon be forgotten. Her name was Phoebe Hinsdale Brown,
and the story of her life is the most pathetic in the annals
of American hymnody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to my history,&rdquo; she wrote near the end of her life,
&ldquo;it is soon told; a sinner saved by grace and sanctified by
trials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was born at Canaan, N. Y., May 1, 1783. Both
parents died before she was two years old and the greater
part of her childhood was spent in the home of an older
sister who was married to a keeper of a county jail. The
cruelties and privations suffered by the orphaned child during
these years were such that her son in later years declared
that it broke his heart to read of them in his mother&rsquo;s diary.
She was not permitted to attend school, and could neither
read nor write. She was eighteen years old before she
escaped from this bondage and found opportunity to attend
school for three months. This was the extent of her education
within school walls.</p>
<p>In 1805, at the age of twenty-two, she married Timothy
H. Brown, a house painter. He was a good man, but extremely
poor. Moving to Ellington, Mass., they lived in
a small, unfinished frame house at the edge of the village.
Four little children and a sick sister who occupied the only
finished room in the house added to the domestic burdens of
<span class="pb" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
Mrs. Brown. In the summer of 1818 a pathetic incident
occurred that led to the writing of her most famous hymn.</p>
<p>There being no place in her crowded home where she
might find opportunity for a few moments of quiet prayer
and meditation, she would steal away at twilight to the edge
of a neighboring estate, where there was a magnificent home
surrounded by a beautiful garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As there was seldom any one passing that way after
dark,&rdquo; she afterwards wrote, &ldquo;I felt quite retired and alone
with God. I often walked quite up to that beautiful garden
... and felt that I could have the privilege of those
few moments of uninterrupted communion with God without
encroaching upon any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her movements had been watched, and one day the
lady of the mansion turned on her in the presence of others
and rudely demanded: &ldquo;Mrs. Brown, why do you come
up at evening so near our house, and then go back without
coming in? If you want anything, why don&rsquo;t you come in
and ask for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown tells how she went home, crushed in spirit.
&ldquo;After my children were all in bed, except my baby,&rdquo; she
continues, &ldquo;I sat down in the kitchen, with my child in my
arms, when the grief of my heart burst forth in a flood
of tears. I took pen and paper, and gave vent to my oppressed
heart in what I called &lsquo;My Apology for my Twilight
Rambles, addressed to a Lady.&rsquo;&rdquo; The &ldquo;Apology,&rdquo; which
was sent to the woman who had so cruelly wounded her
began with the lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yes, when the toilsome day is gone,</p>
<p class="t">And night, with banners gray,</p>
<p class="t0">Steals silently the glade along</p>
<p class="t">In twilight&rsquo;s soft array.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_355">[355]</div>
<p>Then continued the beautiful verses of her now famous
&ldquo;Twilight Hymn:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I love to steal awhile away</p>
<p class="t">From little ones and care,</p>
<p class="t0">And spend the hours of setting day</p>
<p class="t">In gratitude and prayer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Seven years later, when Dr. Nettleton was preparing his
volume of &ldquo;Village Hymns,&rdquo; he was told that Mrs. Brown
had written some verses. At his request she brought forth
her &ldquo;Twilight Hymn&rdquo; and three other lyrics, and they were
promptly given a place in the collection. Only a few slight
changes were made in the lines of the &ldquo;Twilight Hymn,&rdquo;
including the second line, which was made to read &ldquo;From
every cumbering care,&rdquo; and the fourth line, which was
changed to &ldquo;In humble, grateful prayer.&rdquo; Four stanzas
were omitted, otherwise the hymn remains almost exactly
in the form of the &ldquo;Apology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the omitted stanzas reveals a beautiful Christian
attitude toward death. Mrs. Brown wrote:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I love to meditate on death!</p>
<p class="t">When shall his message come</p>
<p class="t0">With friendly smiles to steal my breath</p>
<p class="t">And take an exile home?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the other hymns by Mrs. Brown included in
&ldquo;Village Hymns&rdquo; is a missionary lyric, &ldquo;Go, messenger of
love, and bear.&rdquo; This was written a year earlier than her
&ldquo;Twilight Hymn.&rdquo; Her little son Samuel was seven years
old at the time, and the pious mother&rsquo;s prayer was that he
might be used of the Lord in His service. It was the period
when the English-speaking world was experiencing a tremendous
revival of interest in foreign missions, and in her
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
heart she cherished the fond hope that her own boy might
become a messenger of the gospel. Then came the inspiration
for the hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Go, messenger of love, and bear</p>
<p class="t">Upon thy gentle wing</p>
<p class="t0">The song which seraphs love to hear,</p>
<p class="t">The angels joy to sing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Go to the heart with sin oppressed,</p>
<p class="t">And dry the sorrowing tear;</p>
<p class="t0">Extract the thorn that wounds the breast,</p>
<p class="t">The drooping spirit cheer.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Go, say to Zion, &ldquo;Jesus reigns&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">By His resistless power</p>
<p class="t0">He binds His enemies with chains;</p>
<p class="t">They fall to rise no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tell how the Holy Spirit flies,</p>
<p class="t">As He from heaven descends;</p>
<p class="t0">Arrests His proudest enemies,</p>
<p class="t">And changes them to friends.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Her prayer was answered. The son, Samuel R. Brown
in 1838 sailed as a missionary to China, and eleven years
later, when Japan was opened to foreigners, he was transferred
to that field. He was the first American missionary
to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown died at Henry, Illinois, October 10, 1861.
She was buried at Monson, Mass., where some thirty years
of her life had been spent. Her son, the missionary, has
written this beautiful tribute to her memory:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her record is on high, and she is with the Lord, whom
she loved and served as faithfully as any person I ever knew;
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
nay, more than any other. To her I owe all I am; and
if I have done any good in the world, to her, under God,
it is due. She seems even now to have me in her hands,
holding me up to work for Christ and His cause with a
grasp that I can feel. I ought to have been and to be a
far better man than I am, having had such a mother.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c61" title="Thomas Hastings, Poet and Musician">
<div class="pb" id="Page_359">[359]</div>
<h3>THOMAS HASTINGS, POET AND MUSICIAN</h3>
<p>High among the names of those who in the early days
of America labored to raise the standard of hymnody
must be inscribed the name of Thomas Hastings,
Doctor of Music. Poet and musician by nature, Hastings
may truly be said to have devoted his entire life to the
elevation of sacred song.</p>
<p>The story of his life is typical of the struggles and hardships
of many American pioneers who conquered in spite
of the most adverse circumstances. Born at Washington,
Conn., October 15, 1784, young Hastings removed with
his parents to Clinton, N. Y., when he was only twelve
years old. The journey was made in ox-sleds through unbroken
wilderness in the dead of winter.</p>
<p>The frontier schools of those days offered little opportunity
for education, but the eager lad trudged six miles a
day to receive the instruction that was given. A passionate
fondness for music was first satisfied when he secured a
musical primer of four pages costing six pence. The proudest
moment in his life came when he was named leader of
the village choir.</p>
<p>It was not until he was thirty-two years old that Hastings
was able to secure employment as a music teacher, but from
that time until his death, in 1872, he devoted all his energies
to the work he loved.</p>
<p>Hastings was ever tireless in contending that good music
should have a recognized place in religious worship. From
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
1823 to 1832, during which time he edited the Western
Recorder, in Utica, N. Y., he had an excellent opportunity
to spread his views on music. In the latter year twelve
churches in New York City jointly engaged his services as
choir director, and for the remainder of his life Hastings
made the great American metropolis his home.</p>
<p>Though seriously handicapped by eye trouble, Hastings
produced a prodigious amount of work. It is claimed that
he wrote more than one thousand hymn tunes. He also
published fifty volumes of church music. Some of the finest
tunes in our American hymnals were composed by him.
Who has not found inspiration in singing that sweet and
haunting melody known as &ldquo;Ortonville&rdquo;? And how can
we ever be sufficiently grateful for the tune called &ldquo;Toplady,&rdquo;
which has endeared &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; to millions of
hearts? Besides these there are at least a score of other
beautiful hymn tunes that have been loved by the singing
Church for nearly a century, any one of which would have
won for the composer an enduring name.</p>
<p>Through the composing of tunes, Hastings was led to
write words for hymns. More than six hundred are attributed
to him, although many were written anonymously.
&ldquo;Hail to the brightness of Zion&rsquo;s glad morning&rdquo; is generally
regarded as his best hymn. It strikingly reflects the spirit
of the missionary age in which Hastings lived.</p>
<p>Another very popular and stirring missionary hymn, written
by Hastings in 1831, is a song of two stanzas:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now be the gospel banner</p>
<p class="t">In every land unfurled;</p>
<p class="t0">And be the shout, Hosannah!</p>
<p class="t">Reechoed through the world;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_361">[361]</div>
<p class="t0">Till every isle and nation,</p>
<p class="t">Till every tribe and tongue,</p>
<p class="t0">Receive the great salvation,</p>
<p class="t">And join the happy throng.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yes, Thou shalt reign forever,</p>
<p class="t">O Jesus, King of kings!</p>
<p class="t0">Thy light, Thy love, Thy favor,</p>
<p class="t">Each ransomed captive sings:</p>
<p class="t0">The isles for Thee are waiting,</p>
<p class="t">The deserts learn Thy praise,</p>
<p class="t0">The hills and valleys, greeting,</p>
<p class="t">The songs responsive raise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A hymn with the title, &ldquo;Pilgrimage of Life,&rdquo; though very
simple, is singularly beautiful and very tender in its appeal.
The first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Gently, Lord, O gently lead us,</p>
<p class="t">Pilgrims in this vale of tears,</p>
<p class="t0">Through the trials yet decreed us,</p>
<p class="t">Till our last great change appears.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hastings did not cease writing and composing hymns until
three days before his death. It is said that more of his
hymns are found in the standard church hymnals of America
than those of any other American writer. Their survival
through almost a century is a testimony to their enduring
quality.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_363">[363]</div>
<h3>FRANCIS SCOTT KEY, PATRIOT AND HYMNIST</h3>
<p>Francis Scott Key is known to every American
child as the author of our national anthem, &ldquo;The star
spangled banner&rdquo;; but his fame as a Christian hymnist
has not gone abroad to the same degree. And yet, as
the author of &ldquo;Lord, with glowing heart I&rsquo;d praise Thee,&rdquo;
he ranks among the foremost of American hymn-writers.</p>
<p>Key lived during the stirring days of our country&rsquo;s early
history. His father was an officer in the Continental army
who fought with distinction during the Revolutionary War.
Francis was born at Frederick, Maryland, August 1, 1779.
After receiving a legal education he began to practice law
in Washington, and served as United States district attorney
for three terms, holding that office at the time of his
death.</p>
<p>The story of how he came to write &ldquo;Star spangled banner&rdquo;
scarcely needs to be repeated. It was during the War
of 1812 that Key was authorized by President Madison to
visit the British fleet near the mouth of the Potomac in
order to obtain the release of a friend who had been captured.</p>
<p>The British admiral granted Key&rsquo;s request, but owing
to the fact that an attack was about to be made on Fort
McHenry, which guarded the harbor of Baltimore, Key
and his party were detained all night aboard the truce-boat
on which they had come.</p>
<p>It was a night of great anxiety. A fierce bombardment
<span class="pb" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
continued during the hours of darkness, and as long as the
shore fortifications replied to the cannonading, Key and his
friends were certain that all was well. Toward morning,
the firing ceased, and they were filled with dark forebodings.
The others went below to obtain some sleep, but Key continued
to pace the deck until the first streaks of dawn showed
that the &ldquo;flag was still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His joy was so unbounded that he seized a piece of paper,
and hastily wrote the words of his famous anthem. It
was not completed until later in the day, when he reached
Baltimore and joined in the victorious joy that filled the
city.</p>
<p>While &ldquo;Star spangled banner&rdquo; is not a Christian hymn,
there are noble sentiments in it that reveal the writer at
once as a devout Christian, and this was eminently true of
Key.</p>
<p>As a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church he held
a lay reader&rsquo;s license, and for many years read the service
and visited the sick. He also conducted a Bible class in
Sunday school. Although he lived in a slave state, he was
finally moved by conscientious scruples to free his slaves.
He also did much to alleviate conditions among other
unfortunate blacks.</p>
<p>When the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1823 appointed
a committee to prepare a new hymn-book for that
body, Key was made a lay member of it. Another member
of the committee was Dr. William Muhlenberg, who
in that same year had published a little hymnal for use in
his own congregation. It was in this hymnal, known as
&ldquo;Church Poetry&rdquo;, that Key&rsquo;s beautiful hymn, &ldquo;Lord, with
glowing heart I&rsquo;d praise Thee,&rdquo; was first published.</p>
<p>In Dr. Muhlenberg&rsquo;s hymn-book the hymn had only
<span class="pb" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
three stanzas, and that is the form in which it has since appeared
in all other hymnals. In 1900, however, Key&rsquo;s autograph
copy of the hymn was discovered, and it was found
that the hymn originally had four stanzas. The missing
one reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise thy Saviour God that drew thee</p>
<p class="t">To that cross, new life to give,</p>
<p class="t0">Held a blood-sealed pardon to thee,</p>
<p class="t">Bade thee look to Him and live.</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the grace whose threats alarmed thee,</p>
<p class="t">Roused thee from thy fatal ease,</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the grace whose promise warmed thee,</p>
<p class="t">Praise the grace that whispered peace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another excellent hymn, &ldquo;Before the Lord we bow&rdquo;, was
written by Key in 1832 for a Fourth of July celebration.</p>
<p>A bronze statue of Key, placed over his grave at Frederick,
Md., shows him with his hand outstretched, as at
the moment when he discovered the flag &ldquo;still there,&rdquo; while
his other hand is waving his hat exultantly.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_367">[367]</div>
<h3>AMERICA&rsquo;S FIRST POET AND HIS HYMNS</h3>
<p>William Cullen Bryant, America&rsquo;s first great poet,
was also a hymn-writer. Although he did not devote
much of his thought and genius to sacred lyrics, he
wrote at least two splendid hymns that merit a place in every
hymn collection. The one, &ldquo;Thou, whose unmeasured temple
stands,&rdquo; is a church dedication hymn of rare beauty; the
other, &ldquo;Look from Thy sphere of endless day,&rdquo; is unquestionably
one of the finest home mission hymns ever written.</p>
<p>Born at Cummington, Mass., November 3, 1794, he was
educated at Williams College to be a lawyer. It was his
writing of &ldquo;Thanatopsis&rdquo; as a boy of seventeen years that
gave the first notice to the world that America had produced
a great poet.</p>
<p>It is said that when the lines of &ldquo;Thanatopsis&rdquo; were submitted
to Richard H. Dana, editor of the &ldquo;North American
Review,&rdquo; he was skeptical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one on this side of the Atlantic,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;is
capable of writing such verses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bryant was brought up in a typical New England Puritan
home. Family worship and strict attendance at public worship
was the rule in the Bryant household. Every little
while the children of the community would also gather in
the district schoolhouse, where they would be examined in
the Catechism by the parish minister, a venerable man who
was loved by old and young alike.</p>
<p>While yet a little child Bryant began to pray that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
might receive the gift of writing poetry. No doubt he had
been influenced to a large degree in this desire by the fact
that his father was a lover of verse and possessed a splendid
library of the great English poets. The youthful Bryant
was taught to memorize the noble hymns of Isaac Watts,
and when he was only five years old he would stand on a
chair and recite them to imaginary audiences.</p>
<p>Early in life Bryant came under the influence of the
Unitarian doctrines which were then sweeping through New
England as a reaction against the stern, harsh teachings of
Puritanism. When he was only twenty-six years old he
was invited to contribute to a volume of hymns then in
course of preparation by the Unitarians. He responded by
writing five hymns. Six years later he wrote &ldquo;Thou, whose
unmeasured temple stands&rdquo; for the dedication of the Second
Unitarian Church of New York City. He usually attended
the First Congregational Unitarian Church of that city.</p>
<p>About thirty years later, however, when Bryant was sixty-four
years old, a profound change occurred in his religious
convictions. During a trip abroad his wife became critically
ill in Naples. At first her life was despaired of, but
when she finally was on the road to recovery Bryant sent
for a warm friend of the family, Rev. R. C. Waterston,
who was in Naples at the time. The latter tells of his meeting
with the aged poet in the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the following day, the weather being delightful, we
walked in the royal park or garden overlooking the Bay of
Naples. Never can I forget the beautiful spirit that
breathed through every word he (Bryant) uttered, the reverent
love, the confiding trust, the aspiring hope, the rooted
faith.... He said that he had never united himself with
the Church, which, with his present feeling, he would most
<span class="pb" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
gladly do. He then asked if it would be agreeable to me to
come to his room on the morrow and administer the communion,
adding that, as he had never been baptized, he desired
that ordinance at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day following was the Sabbath, and a most heavenly
day. In fulfilment of his wishes, in his own quiet room,
a company of seven persons celebrated together the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.... Previous to the breaking of bread, William Cullen
Bryant was baptized. With snow-white head and flowing
beard, he stood like one of the ancient prophets, and
perhaps never, since the days of the apostles, has a truer
disciple professed allegiance to the divine Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty years after this experience, in the last year of the
poet&rsquo;s life, he made some contributions to the Methodist
Episcopal hymnal. A revision of one of the hymns which
he had written in 1820 for the Unitarian hymnal reveals
his changed attitude toward the Lord Jesus Christ. For the
Unitarian book he had written:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Deem not that they are blest alone</p>
<p class="t">Whose days a peaceful tenor keep;</p>
<p class="t0">The God who loves our race has shown</p>
<p class="t">A blessing for the eyes that weep.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the Methodist hymn-book he changed the third line
to read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The anointed Son of God makes known.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hymn was sung in its changed form at the poet&rsquo;s funeral,
as well as another beautiful hymn entitled &ldquo;The Star
of Bethlehem,&rdquo; written in 1875 for the semi-centennial of
the Church of the Messiah in Boston.</p>

</div>
<div id="c64" title="The Hymn-writer of the Muhlenbergs">
<div class="pb" id="Page_371">[371]</div>
<h3>THE HYMN-WRITER OF THE MUHLENBERGS</h3>
<p>William Augustus Muhlenberg, one of America&rsquo;s
early hymn-writers, came from a most distinguished
family. His great grandfather, Henry Melchior
Muhlenberg, was the &ldquo;patriarch of the Lutheran Church in
America,&rdquo; having come to these shores from Germany in
1742, and being the founder in that year of the first permanent
Lutheran organization in the new world.</p>
<p>A son of the patriarch and grandfather of the hymn-writer
bore the name of Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg. He,
too, was a Lutheran minister, but during the stirring days
of the Revolutionary period he entered into the political affairs
of the struggling colonies. He was president of the
convention which ratified the Constitution of the United
States and also served as first speaker of the new House of
Representatives. His brother, Rev. Peter Muhlenberg, was
also a distinguished patriot. When the Revolution broke
out, he was serving a congregation at Woodstock, Va. It
was he who stood in the pulpit of his church and, throwing
aside his clerical robe, stood revealed in the uniform of a
Continental colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a time to preach and a time to pray,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;but these times have passed away. There is a time to fight,
and that time has now come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he called upon the men of his congregation to
enlist in his regiment. Before the war ended he had risen
to the rank of major general.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_372">[372]</div>
<p>William Augustus Muhlenberg, the hymn-writer, was
born in Philadelphia in 1796. Since the German language
was then being used exclusively in the German Lutheran
churches, he and his little sister were allowed to attend
Christ Episcopal Church. In this way William Augustus
drifted away from the Church of his great forbears, and
when he grew up he became a clergyman in the Episcopal
communion.</p>
<p>It is evident that Muhlenberg brought something of the
spirit of the &ldquo;singing church&rdquo; into the church of his adoption,
for in 1821 he issued a tract with the title, &ldquo;A Plea
for Christian Hymns.&rdquo; It appears that the Episcopal
Church at this time was using a prayer-book that included
only fifty-seven hymns, and no one felt the poverty of his
Church in this respect more keenly than did Muhlenberg.</p>
<p>Two years later the General Convention of the Episcopal
body voted to prepare a hymn-book, and Muhlenberg was
made a member of the committee. One of his associates was
Francis Scott Key, author of &ldquo;Star spangled banner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a member of the committee Muhlenberg contributed
four original hymns to the new collection. They were &ldquo;I
would not live alway,&rdquo; &ldquo;Like Noah&rsquo;s weary dove,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shout
the glad tidings, triumphantly sing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Saviour, who Thy
flock art leading.&rdquo; The latter is a baptism hymn and is one
of the most exquisite lyrics on that theme ever written.
Although Muhlenberg never married, he had a very deep love
for children. No service seemed so hallowed to him as the
baptism of a little child. It is said that shortly after his
ordination, when asked to officiate at such a rite, Muhlenberg
flushed and hesitated, and then asked a bishop who was present
to baptize the babe. The latter, however, insisted that
the young clergyman should carry out the holy ordinance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
and from that day there was no duty that afforded Muhlenberg
more joy.</p>
<p>Muhlenberg often expressed regret that he had written &ldquo;I
would not live alway.&rdquo; It seems that the poem was called
into being in 1824, following a &ldquo;heart-breaking disappointment
in the matter of love.&rdquo; Muhlenberg was a young
man at the time, and in his later years he sought to alter it
in such a way that it would breathe more of the hopeful
spirit of the New Testament. He contended that Paul&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;For me to live is Christ&rdquo; were far better than Job&rsquo;s
lament, &ldquo;I would not live alway.&rdquo; However, the hymn as
originally written had become so fixed in the consciousness
of the Church, that all efforts of the author to revise it were
in vain.</p>
<p>Nearly all the hymns of Muhlenberg that have lived were
written during his earlier years. His later ministry centered
in New York City, where he was head of a boys&rsquo; school
for a number of years, and later rector of the Church of the
Holy Communion. He soon became an outstanding leader in the
great metropolis. After having founded St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital,
the first church institution of its kind in New York City, he
spent the last twenty years of his life as its superintendent.</p>
<p>His death occurred when he was past eighty years. It is
said that when the end was drawing near, the hospital chaplain
came to his bedside to pray for his recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have an understanding about this,&rdquo; said the dying
Muhlenberg. &ldquo;You are asking God to restore me and I am
asking God to take me home. There must not be a contradiction
in our prayers, for it is evident that He cannot answer
them both.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div id="c65" title="The Lyrics of Bishop Doane">
<div class="pb" id="Page_375">[375]</div>
<h3>THE LYRICS OF BISHOP DOANE</h3>
<p>Critics will forever disagree on the subject of the
relative merits of great hymns. Bishop George Washington
Doane&rsquo;s fine hymn, &ldquo;Thou art the Way; to
Thee alone,&rdquo; has been declared by some to be the foremost
of all hymns written by American authors. Dr. Breed, on
the other hand, declares that it is &ldquo;by no means the equal&rdquo;
of other hymns by Doane. Another authority observes that
it &ldquo;rather stiffly and mechanically paraphrases&rdquo; the passage
on which it is founded, while Edward S. Ninde rejects this
conclusion by contending that although &ldquo;metrical expositions
of Scriptures are apt to be stilted and spiritless ... this one
is a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninde, however, does not agree that it is &ldquo;the first of
American hymns,&rdquo; reserving this honor, as do most critics,
for Ray Palmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;My faith looks up to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Doane was born in Trenton, N. J., May 27, 1799.
This was the year in which George Washington died. The
future hymn-writer was named after the great patriot. At
the age of nineteen he was graduated by Union College with
the highest scholastic honors. After teaching for a season,
he became pastor of Trinity Episcopal Church, Boston,
Mass., the church afterwards made famous by Phillips
Brooks.</p>
<p>When only thirty-three years old he was elevated to the
bishopric of New Jersey, which position he held until his
death in 1859. By this time he had already won fame as a
hymn-writer. It was in 1824, at the age of twenty-five, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
Doane published a little volume of lyrics entitled &ldquo;Songs by
the Way.&rdquo; One of the hymns in this collection was the
beautiful paraphrase, &ldquo;Thou art the Way; to Thee alone.&rdquo;
This hymn alone would have been sufficient to have perpetuated
the name of the young poet, but there was another
gem in the same collection that will always be treasured by
those who love Christian song. It is the exquisite evening
hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Softly now the light of day</p>
<p class="t0">Fades upon my sight away;</p>
<p class="t0">Free from care, from labor free,</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, I would commune with Thee.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Among the many achievements of this versatile bishop was
the founding of Saint Mary&rsquo;s Hall, a school for young
women, at Burlington, N. J. Doane lies buried in the
neighboring churchyard, and it is said that the students on
every Wednesday evening at chapel services sing &ldquo;Softly
now the light of day&rdquo; as a memorial tribute to the founder
of the institution.</p>
<p>Both of these hymns were quickly recognized as possessing
unusual merit, and almost immediately found their way
into Christian hymn-books. Today there is scarcely a hymnal
published in the English language that does not contain
them.</p>
<p>But Bishop Doane&rsquo;s fame does not rest on these two
hymns alone. He was destined to write a third one, equally
great but of a very different character from the other two.
It is the stirring missionary hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fling out the banner! let it float</p>
<p class="t">Skyward and seaward, high and wide;</p>
<p class="t0">The sun that lights its shining folds,</p>
<p class="t">The cross, on which the Saviour died.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_377">[377]</div>
<p>It was written in 1848 in response to a request from the
young women of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall for a hymn to be used at
a flag-raising. The third stanza is one of rare beauty:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fling out the banner! heathen lands</p>
<p class="t">Shall see from far the glorious sight,</p>
<p class="t0">And nations, crowding to be born,</p>
<p class="t">Baptize their spirits in its light.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The hymn, as may be surmised, is based on the passage
from the Psaltery: &ldquo;Thou hast given a banner to them that
fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Doane was a zealous advocate of missions. It was
during his childhood that the modern missionary movement
had its inception and swept like a tidal wave over the Christian
world. &ldquo;Fling out the banner&rdquo; is a reflection of the
remarkable enthusiasm that filled his own soul and that revealed
itself in his aggressive missionary leadership. Indeed,
he became known in his own Church as &ldquo;the missionary
bishop of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A son, William C. Doane, also became one of the most
distinguished bishops of the Episcopal Church. Writing of
his father&rsquo;s rare gifts as a hymnist, he declares that his heart
was &ldquo;full of song. It oozed out in his conversation, in his
sermons, in everything that he did. Sometimes in a steamboat,
often when the back of a letter was his only paper, the
sweetest things came.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE QUAKER POET AS A HYMN-WRITER</h3>
<p>Of all American poets, there is none who is so genuinely
loved as John Greenleaf Whittier. A man of the
people, a true American, and full of the milk of human
kindness, Whittier&rsquo;s poetry reflects so much of his own
character that it will never lose its singular charm and
beauty.</p>
<p>Whittier&rsquo;s life is a story of struggle. He was born of
humble Quaker parents at Haverhill, Mass., December 17,
1807. Instead of receiving the advantages of an education,
he knew of nothing but drudgery and hard work throughout
his childhood. But the poetic spark was in him even as a
child. One day, when a small boy, he sat before the kitchen
fire and wrote on his slate:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And must I always swing the flail</p>
<p class="t0">And help to fill the milking pail?</p>
<p class="t0">I wish to go away to school;</p>
<p class="t0">I do not wish to be a fool.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>No doubt it was the memory of these childhood experiences
that later inspired him to write with such depth of
feeling and understanding the lines of &ldquo;The Barefoot Boy&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Blessings on thee, little man,</p>
<p class="t0">Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!</p>
<p class="t0">With thy turned-up pantaloons,</p>
<p class="t0">And thy merry whistled tunes;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_380">[380]</div>
<p class="t0">With thy red lips, redder still</p>
<p class="t0">Kissed by strawberries on the hill;</p>
<p class="t0">With the sunshine on thy face,</p>
<p class="t0">Through thy torn brim&rsquo;s jaunty grace:</p>
<p class="t0">From my heart I give thee joy&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">I was once a barefoot boy!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Through hard work he managed to save enough to attend
Haverhill academy two seasons. Though this was the extent
of his scholastic training, he never ceased to be a student.</p>
<p>A wandering Scotchman who chanced to visit the quiet
Quaker home and sang such rollicking (!) lyrics as &ldquo;Bonny
Doon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Highland Mary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; kindled
the boy&rsquo;s imagination. He immediately borrowed a copy of
Burns&rsquo; poems from the village schoolmaster, and now for
the first time he seriously began to think of becoming a poet.</p>
<p>When he was only twenty-five years old he had already
begun to attract attention by his poetry. He had also
achieved some success in politics and was planning to run
for Congress. Soon, however, came the call of the Abolition
movement, and Whittier, always true to his Quaker conception
of &ldquo;the inner voice,&rdquo; determined to sacrifice all of his
political ambitions to become a champion of the slaves.</p>
<p>It was not long before he was recognized as pre&euml;minently
the poet of anti-slavery, as Phillips was its orator, Mrs.
Stowe its novelist, and Sumner its statesman. The fervor
with which he threw himself into the cause may be seen reflected
in the stirring lines of his poems written in those
days, notably &ldquo;The Star of Bethlehem.&rdquo; However, since
his anti-slavery poems are more vehement than inspiring,
and as the events which suggested them were temporary, they
will be read with constantly waning interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_381">[381]</div>
<p>The vigor with which he espoused the Abolition cause
stirred up deep resentment among his enemies. At Philadelphia,
where he published &ldquo;The Pennsylvania Free-man,&rdquo;
the office of the paper was attacked by a mob and burned.
But Whittier was not dismayed. When Daniel Webster in
1850 made his notable defense of the Fugitive Slave law in
the United States senate, Whittier wrote &ldquo;Ichabod&rdquo; in reply.</p>
<p>At a time when the Abolition movement seemed to be
losing, rather than gaining, ground, the poet gave expression
to his faith in God in the beautiful poem, &ldquo;Seed-Time and
Harvest.&rdquo; His duty, as he saw it, was to sow the seed;
God would take care of the harvest.</p>
<p>Because the Quakers do not sing in their services, Whittier
knew little of music. However, he once wrote: &ldquo;A good
hymn is the best use to which poetry can be devoted, but I
do not claim that I have succeeded in composing one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, the poems of Whittier, notably &ldquo;Our Master&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Eternal Goodness,&rdquo; have been the source of some
of the finest hymns in the English language. There are at
least seventy-five hymns now in use that bear his name. Practically
all of them are extracts from longer poems. &ldquo;Dear
Lord and Father of mankind,&rdquo; &ldquo;I bow my forehead to the
dust,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We need not climb the heavenly steeps&rdquo; are
among the best loved of Whittier&rsquo;s hymns. Probably his
most famous poem is &ldquo;Snowbound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whittier died in 1892. His last words were, &ldquo;Love&mdash;love
to all the world.&rdquo; A friend bent over the dying man
and whispered the words of his poem, &ldquo;At Last.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c67" title="America&rsquo;s Greatest Hymn and Its Author">
<div class="pb" id="Page_383">[383]</div>
<h3>AMERICA&rsquo;S GREATEST HYMN AND ITS AUTHOR</h3>
<p>Although a number of America&rsquo;s great poets
wrote hymns, it was not given to any one of them
to compose America&rsquo;s finest Christian lyric. Bryant
wrote &ldquo;Look from Thy sphere of endless day,&rdquo; Whittier
was the author of &ldquo;Dear Lord and Father of mankind,&rdquo;
Holmes composed &ldquo;O Love Divine, that stooped to share,&rdquo;
and Longfellow has given us &ldquo;I heard the bells of Christmas
day;&rdquo; but, beautiful as these hymns are, none of them
can compare with &ldquo;My faith looks up to Thee.&rdquo; This, &ldquo;the
most precious contribution which American genius has yet
made to the hymnology of the Christian Church,&rdquo; came from
the pen of a very humble but gifted minister, Ray Palmer.</p>
<p>Palmer, who was born at Little Compton, R. I., November
12, 1808, was a direct descendant of John Alden and
his good wife, Priscilla. One of his forebears was William
Palmer, who came to Plymouth in 1621.</p>
<p>Through pressure of poverty Ray found it necessary to
leave home at the age of thirteen, after having received a
grammar education. For two years he clerked in a Boston
dry goods store, during which time he passed through some
deep spiritual experiences, with the result that he gave his
heart to God.</p>
<p>Friends who recognized unusual gifts in the young man
urged him to attend school. Eventually he graduated from
Phillips Andover Academy and from Yale. For a while he
taught in New York and New Haven, but in 1835 he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
ordained to the Congregational ministry. He served a
congregation in Bath, Maine, for fifteen years, and another at
Albany, N. Y., for a like period, after which he became
Corresponding Secretary of the American Congregational Union,
a position which he held until 1878, when he was compelled
to retire because of failing health.</p>
<p>It was while he was teaching in New York City that &ldquo;My
faith looks up to Thee&rdquo; was written. He was only twenty-two
years old at the time, and he had no thought when
writing it that he was composing a hymn for general use.
He tells in his own account of the hymn how he had been
reading a little German poem of two stanzas, picturing a
penitent sinner before the cross. Deeply moved by the lines,
he translated them into English, and then added the four
stanzas that form his own hymn.</p>
<p>The words of the hymn, he tells us, were born out of his
own spiritual experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave form to what I felt, by writing, with little effort,
the stanzas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I recollect I wrote them with very
tender emotion, and ended the last lines with tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ransomed soul!&rdquo; Who would not have been moved
to deep emotion after having written a poem with such a
sublime closing line!</p>
<p>This happened in the year 1832, almost a hundred years
ago.</p>
<p>Palmer copied the poem into a little note-book which he
constantly carried in his pocket. Frequently he would read
it as a part of his private devotion. It never seemed to occur
to him that it might some day be used as a hymn.</p>
<p>But God was watching over that little poem. One day
as Palmer was walking along the busy streets of Boston, he
chanced to meet Lowell Mason, the famous musician and
<span class="pb" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
composer of Savannah, Ga. Mason was compiling a hymn-book
at the time and asked Palmer, who had established
something of a reputation as a poet, if he could give him some
words for which he could compose music. Palmer remembered
the poem in his note-book, and, while the two men
stepped into a nearby store, a copy of the poem was made
and given to Mason.</p>
<p>When the two men met again a few days later, Mason
exclaimed: &ldquo;Dr. Palmer, you may live many years and do
many good things, but I think you will be best known to
posterity as the author of &lsquo;My faith looks up to Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason wrote the beautiful tune known as &ldquo;Olivet&rdquo; for
the hymn, and perhaps the music contributed as much as the
words to endear it to the hearts of millions. Certainly here
is an instance where words and music are wedded, and
should never be parted asunder.</p>
<p>Palmer wrote many other splendid hymns. Some of his
most famous are translations from the Latin. His rendering
of the noted hymn of Bernard of Clairvaux, &ldquo;O Jesus, Joy
of loving hearts,&rdquo; is a gem of wondrous beauty. It has become
a favorite communion hymn.</p>
<p>In his ministry Palmer laid much emphasis on the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, and many of his hymns were written for communion
services. He once said, in a communion address: &ldquo;When
the cares and the business of life have hurried me hither and
thither with no little distraction of mind, I love to come back
again, and sit down before the cross, and gaze on the blessed
Sufferer with silent, tender memories. It is like coming once
more into the sunshine after long walking through gloom
and mist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palmer&rsquo;s whole life was characterized by a warm, almost
passionate, devotion to Christ. His faith in the Saviour was
<span class="pb" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
so childlike and strong that it enabled him to rise above all
external burdens and trials. Something of his personal love
to Christ may be seen beautifully reflected in his hymn, &ldquo;Jesus,
these eyes have never seen,&rdquo; which was his own favorite
and which many regard as inferior only to &ldquo;My faith looks
up to Thee.&rdquo; It is such an appealing lyric, we feel we must
quote it in full.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, these eyes have never seen</p>
<p class="t">That radiant form of Thine!</p>
<p class="t0">The veil of sense hangs dark between</p>
<p class="t">Thy blessed face and mine!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,</p>
<p class="t">Yet art Thou oft with me!</p>
<p class="t0">And earth hath ne&rsquo;er so dear a spot</p>
<p class="t">As where I meet with Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like some bright dream that comes unsought,</p>
<p class="t">When slumbers o&rsquo;er me roll,</p>
<p class="t0">Thine image ever fills my thought,</p>
<p class="t">And charms my ravished soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet though I have not seen, and still</p>
<p class="t">Must rest in faith alone,</p>
<p class="t0">I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,</p>
<p class="t">Unseen, but not unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When death these mortal eyes shall seal,</p>
<p class="t">And still this throbbing heart,</p>
<p class="t0">The rending veil shall Thee reveal,</p>
<p class="t">All glorious as Thou art.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Palmer looked upon his hymns as gifts from heaven, and
therefore he refused to accept money for their use. He insisted,
however, that those who published his hymns should
print them exactly as they were written. He regarded the
<span class="pb" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
somewhat common practice of tampering with texts as &ldquo;immoral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palmer died in 1887. On the day before he breathed
his last, he was heard repeating feebly the last stanza of his
favorite hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When death these mortal eyes shall seal,</p>
<p class="t">And still this throbbing heart,</p>
<p class="t0">The rending veil shall Thee reveal,</p>

<div id="c68" title="Samuel Smith, a Patriotic Hymn-Writer">
<div class="pb" id="Page_389">[389]</div>
<h3>SAMUEL SMITH, A PATRIOTIC HYMN-WRITER</h3>
<p>Nearly a century has now elapsed since our national
hymn, &ldquo;America,&rdquo; was written, and, despite all efforts
to displace it by other anthems, it seems to retain
its hold on the hearts of the people. Samuel Francis
Smith will always be gratefully remembered as the author
of this hymn, but we should not lose sight of the fact that
the New England pastor who gave his country such an inspiring
patriotic song has also given to the Christian Church
some of the choicest gems in her hymnody.</p>
<p>Associated with &ldquo;My country, &rsquo;tis of thee&rdquo; will be the
stirring missionary hymn, &ldquo;The morning light is breaking,&rdquo;
the two being regarded as the foremost of Dr. Smith&rsquo;s poetical
works. Both were written in the winter of 1832,
when he was only twenty-four years old. He was a student
at Andover Theological Seminary at the time.</p>
<p>Altogether Dr. Smith contributed nearly 150 hymns to
American hymnody, many of them on missionary themes.
They were written in an era that witnessed a remarkable revival
of interest in foreign missions. The famous &ldquo;Haystack
Meeting&rdquo; at Williams College, which marked the beginning
of the modern missionary movement in America, was held
in 1806, just two years before Smith was born. Smith himself,
while a theological student at Andover, caught the spirit
of the times and felt constrained to become a missionary.</p>
<p>At this time reports came from Adoniram Judson in Burmah
that, after years of painful disappointment and failure,
<span class="pb" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
the light was breaking, and multitudes were turning to
Christ. Smith was fired with hopeful enthusiasm, and it was
in this spirit of glad exultation that he sat down to write his
immortal missionary hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The morning light is breaking,</p>
<p class="t">The darkness disappears;</p>
<p class="t0">The sons of earth are waking</p>
<p class="t">To penitential tears.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Many other missionary hymns came from the gifted writer
in succeeding years, and immediately after his graduation
from Andover he became editor of a missionary magazine,
through which he wielded a great influence. When the
&ldquo;Lone Star&rdquo; mission in India was in danger of being abandoned
because of lack of funds, Smith did much to save it
by writing a poem with the title, &ldquo;Lone Star.&rdquo; Another
missionary hymn by him begins with the line, &ldquo;Onward
speed thy conquering flight.&rdquo; However, it does not attain
to the poetic heights of &ldquo;The morning light is breaking,&rdquo;
which has been compared to Heber&rsquo;s &ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy
mountains&rdquo; in spiritual fervor and literary merit.</p>
<p>Another interesting hymn written by Smith during his
student days is called &ldquo;The Missionary&rsquo;s Farewell.&rdquo; The
first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yes, my native land, I love thee;</p>
<p class="t">All thy scenes, I love them well;</p>
<p class="t0">Friends, connections, happy country,</p>
<p class="t">Can I bid you all farewell?</p>
<p class="t2">Can I leave you,</p>
<p class="t">Far in heathen lands to dwell?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">[391]</div>
<p>Although Dr. Smith never carried out his earlier resolve
to become a missionary, he visited many foreign fields and
had the satisfaction of hearing his own hymns sung in many
tongues. Referring to &ldquo;The morning light is breaking,&rdquo; he
once wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a great favorite at missionary gatherings, and
I have myself heard it sung in five or six different languages
in Europe and Asia. It is a favorite with the Burmans,
Karens and Telugus in Asia, from whose lips I have heard it
repeatedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A son of the distinguished hymn-writer became a missionary
to the Burmans.</p>
<p>Dr. Smith filled many important pulpits in New England
during his long and illustrious career. At one time he was
a professor in modern languages. He was an unusual linguist,
being familiar with fifteen tongues. In 1894, a year
before his death, he was still vigorous in mind and body,
writing and preaching, although he was eighty-six years old.
It was in this year that he was found looking around for a
textbook that would enable him to begin the study of Russian.
It was in this year, too, that he wrote one of his finest
hymns, for a church dedication.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Founded on Thee, our only Lord,</p>
<p class="t">On Thee, the everlasting Rock,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Church shall stand as stands Thy Word,</p>
<p class="t">Nor fear the storm, nor dread the shock.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For Thee our waiting spirits yearn,</p>
<p class="t">For Thee this house of praise we rear;</p>
<p class="t0">To Thee with longing hearts we turn;</p>
<p class="t">Come, fix Thy glorious presence here.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_392">[392]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, with Thy Spirit and Thy power,</p>
<p class="t">The Conqueror, once the Crucified;</p>
<p class="t0">Our God, our Strength, our King, our Tower,</p>
<p class="t">Here plant Thy throne, and here abide.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Accept the work our hands have wrought;</p>
<p class="t">Accept, O God, this earthly shrine;</p>
<p class="t0">Be Thou our Rock, our Life, our Thought,</p>
<p class="t">And we, as living temples, Thine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The celebrated hymnist happily has left a personal account
of how he wrote &ldquo;America.&rdquo; Lowell Mason, the composer,
had given him a collection of German books containing
songs for children with the request that Smith should
examine them and translate anything of merit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One dismal day in February, 1832,&rdquo; he wrote long afterward,
&ldquo;about half an hour before sunset, I was turning
over the leaves of one of the music books when my eye rested
on the tune which is now known as &lsquo;America.&rsquo; I liked the
spirited movement of it, not knowing it at that time to be
&lsquo;God save the King.&rsquo; I glanced at the German words and
saw that they were patriotic, and instantly felt the impulse
to write a patriotic hymn of my own, adapted to the tune.
Picking up a scrap of waste paper which lay near me, I
wrote at once, probably within half an hour, the hymn
&rsquo;America&rsquo; as it is now known everywhere. The whole hymn
stands today as it stood on the bit of waste paper, five or six
inches long and two and a half wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Smith was a member of the celebrated Harvard class
of 1829, to which Oliver Wendell Holmes also belonged.
The latter wrote a poem for one of the class reunions, in
which he referred to the distinguished hymn-writer in the
following lines:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_393">[393]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And there&rsquo;s a nice youngster of excellent pith&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith;</p>
<p class="t0">But he shouted a song for the brave and the free&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Just read on his medal, &lsquo;My country,&rsquo; &lsquo;of thee.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On November 19, 1895, the venerable pastor and poet was
called suddenly to his eternal home. He died as he was taking
a train from Boston to preach in a neighboring town.</p>

<h3>TWO FAMOUS CHRISTMAS HYMNS AND THEIR AUTHOR</h3>
<p>To be the writer of one great hymn classic on the nativity
is an enviable distinction, but to be the author
of two immortal Christmas lyrics is fame that has
probably come to only one man, and he an American. His
name was Edmund Hamilton Sears, and so long as Christians
celebrate Christmas, they will sing the two hymns he
wrote&mdash;&ldquo;It came upon a midnight clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Calm on the
listening ear of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, an interval of sixteen years separated
the writing of the two hymns. Sears had just graduated
from Union College at the age of twenty-four when he
wrote &ldquo;Calm on the listening ear of night.&rdquo; It appeared
in the &ldquo;Boston Observer,&rdquo; and was immediately recognized
as a poem of unusual merit. Oliver Wendell Holmes spoke
of it as &ldquo;one of the finest and most beautiful hymns ever
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sixteen years elapsed, and then at Christmas time in 1850
the Christian world was delighted to find in the &ldquo;Christian
Register&rdquo; another lyric, &ldquo;It came upon the midnight clear,&rdquo;
which many believe is superior to the earlier hymn. The
language of this hymn is so surpassingly lovely and its movement
so rhythmical, it fairly sings itself.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, a close resemblance between the two hymns,
and yet they are different. While the earlier hymn is largely
descriptive, the later one is characterized by a note of joyous
optimism and triumphant faith. In Sears&rsquo; &ldquo;Sermons
<span class="pb" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
and Songs&rdquo; he published the one at the beginning, and
the other at the close, of a sermon for Christmas Eve on
1 Tim. 2:6.</p>
<p>Each of the two hymns had five stanzas in its original
form. The fourth stanza of the older hymn is usually
omitted. It reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Light on thy hills, Jerusalem!</p>
<p class="t">The Saviour now is born;</p>
<p class="t0">More bright on Bethlehem&rsquo;s joyous plains</p>
<p class="t">Breaks the first Christmas morn;</p>
<p class="t0">And brighter on Moriah&rsquo;s brow,</p>
<p class="t">Crowned with her temple-spires,</p>
<p class="t0">Which first proclaim the new-born light,</p>
<p class="t">Clothed with its orient fires.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The stanza omitted from the second Christmas hymn
sounds the only minor note heard in that otherwise hopeful
and joyous lyric:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet with the woes of sin and strife</p>
<p class="t">The world hath suffered long;</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath the angel-strain have rolled</p>
<p class="t">Two thousand years of wrong;</p>
<p class="t0">And man, at war with man, hears not</p>
<p class="t">The love song which they bring:</p>
<p class="t0">O hush the noise, ye men of strife,</p>
<p class="t">And hear the angels sing!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sears was a native of New England, having been born
in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, in 1810. He completed
his theological course at Harvard Divinity School in
1837, whereupon he entered the Unitarian Church, serving
as a pastor for nearly forty years.</p>
<p>Surprise has often been expressed that a Unitarian could
write such marvelous hymns on the nativity; but Sears was
<span class="pb" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
a Unitarian in name rather than in fact. He leaned strongly
toward Swedenborgian teachings, and believed implicitly
in the deity of Christ.</p>
<p>In addition to his hymns, he wrote a few works in prose.
His books on &ldquo;Regeneration,&rdquo; &ldquo;Foregleams of Immortality,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Fourth Gospel the Heart of Christ&rdquo; were
widely read in his day. These have now been almost entirely
forgotten, but his two great hymns go singing through
the years. They are found in practically all standard hymn-books,
although the final stanza of &ldquo;It came upon the midnight
clear&rdquo; is often altered. Sears died in 1876.</p>

<div id="c70" title="Harriet Beecher Stowe and Her Hymns">
<div class="pb" id="Page_399">[399]</div>
<h3>HARRIET BEECHER STOWE AND HER HYMNS</h3>
<p>Through the fame that her book, &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s
Cabin,&rdquo; brought her, the name of Harriet Beecher
Stowe has become almost a household word on both
sides of the Atlantic. But not many, perhaps, are familiar
with Mrs. Stowe the hymn-writer. And yet she wrote a
number of hymns that are worthy of finding a place in the
best of collections. Indeed, for sheer poetic beauty there
is probably not a single American lyric that can excel &ldquo;Still,
still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was her brother, Henry Ward Beecher, who introduced
Mrs. Stowe as a hymn-writer, when he included three of
her hymns in the &ldquo;Plymouth Collection,&rdquo; which he edited
in 1865. One of the three was the hymn mentioned above;
the other two were &ldquo;That mystic word of Thine, O sovereign
Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;When winds are raging o&rsquo;er the upper ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like the Wesley family in England, the Beecher family
became one of the most famous in religious and literary
circles in America. Harriet Beecher was born in Litchfield,
Conn., June 14, 1812. Her father was the noted Dr.
Lyman Beecher, a distinguished clergyman of his day. Her
mother, a very devout Christian, died when Harriet was
less than four years of age. Her dying prayer was that
her six sons might be called into the ministry. That prayer
was answered, and the youngest of them, Henry Ward
Beecher, who was only a boy when the mother died, became
one of America&rsquo;s greatest preachers. We do not know what
<span class="pb" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
the dying mother&rsquo;s prayer for her daughter was, but we
do know that Harriet Beecher achieved fame such as comes
to few women. Even as a child she revealed a spiritual
nature of unusual depth. An earnest sermon preached by
her father when she was fourteen made such an impression
on her youthful heart that she determined to give herself
wholly to Christ. She tells of the experience in these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as my father came home and was seated in his
study, I went up to him and fell in his arms, saying, &lsquo;Father,
I have given myself to Jesus, and He has taken me.&rsquo; I never
shall forget the expression of his face as he looked down
into my earnest childish eyes; it was so sweet, so gentle,
and like sunlight breaking out upon a landscape. &lsquo;Is it so?&rsquo;
he said, holding me silently to his heart, as I felt the hot
tears fall on my head. &lsquo;Then has a new flower blossomed
in the kingdom this day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1832 the father removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he
became president of Lane Theological Seminary. Here
Harriet married Prof. Calvin E. Stowe, a member of the
faculty. Many misfortunes and sorrows came into her
life, but always she was sustained by her strong faith in
God, and she bore them with unusual Christian fortitude.
In 1849 her infant boy was snatched from her by the dreadful
cholera scourge. Her husband, broken in health, was
in an Eastern sanatorium at the time, and all the cares and
anxieties of the household fell upon the shoulders of the
brave young wife. A letter written to her husband, dated
June 29, 1849, gives a graphic description of the plague as
it was then raging in Cincinnati. She wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This week has been unusually fatal. The disease in
the city has been malignant and virulent. Hearse drivers
have scarce been allowed to unharness their horses, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
furniture carts and common vehicles are often employed
for the removal of the dead. The sable trains which pass
our windows, the frequent indications of crowding haste,
and the absence of reverent decency have, in many cases,
been most painful.... On Tuesday, one hundred and sixteen
deaths from cholera were reported, and that night the
air was of that peculiarly oppressive, deathly kind that seems
to lie like lead on the brain and soul. As regards your
coming home, I am decidedly opposed to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under date of July 26, she wrote again: &ldquo;At last it is
over and our dear little one is gone from us. He is now
among the blessed. My Charley&mdash;my beautiful, loving,
gladsome baby, so loving, so sweet, so full of life, and hope
and strength&mdash;now lies shrouded, pale and cold, in the room
below.... I write as though there were no sorrow like
my sorrow, yet there has been in this city, as in the land of
Egypt, scarce a house without its dead. This heart-break,
this anguish, has been everywhere, and when it will end
God alone knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The succeeding years brought other tragedies to the sorely
tried family. In 1857 the eldest son, Henry, pride of his
mother&rsquo;s heart, was drowned at the close of his freshman
year at Dartmouth College. Then came the Civil War
with its bloody battles. At Gettysburg a third son, Fred,
was wounded in the head by a piece of shrapnel. Although
it did not prove fatal, his mental faculties were permanently
impaired.</p>
<p>Through all these afflictions the marvelous faith of Mrs.
Stowe remained firm and unshaken. Many years afterwards,
in looking back upon these bitter experiences, she
wrote: &ldquo;I thank God there is one thing running through
all of them from the time I was thirteen years old, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
that is the intense unwavering sense of Christ&rsquo;s educating,
guiding presence and care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the midst of these dark tragedies that Mrs.
Stowe wrote a hymn entitled &ldquo;The Secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When winds are raging o&rsquo;er the upper ocean,</p>
<p class="t">And billows wild contend with angry roar,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis said, far down, beneath the wild commotion,</p>
<p class="t">That peaceful stillness reigneth evermore.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Far, far beneath, the noise of tempests dieth,</p>
<p class="t">And silver waves chime ever peacefully;</p>
<p class="t0">And no rude storm, how fierce soe&rsquo;er it flieth,</p>
<p class="t">Disturbs the Sabbath of that deeper sea.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So to the heart that knows Thy love, O Purest!</p>
<p class="t">There is a temple sacred evermore,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the babble of life&rsquo;s angry voices</p>
<p class="t">Dies in hushed stillness at its sacred door.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Far, far away, the roar of passion dieth,</p>
<p class="t">And loving thoughts rise calm and peacefully;</p>
<p class="t0">And no rude storm, how fierce soe&rsquo;er it flieth,</p>
<p class="t">Disturbs that deeper rest, O Lord, in Thee!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Rest of rests! O Peace serene, eternal!</p>
<p class="t">Thou ever livest, and Thou changest never;</p>
<p class="t0">And in the secret of Thy presence dwelleth</p>
<p class="t">Fulness of joy, forever and forever.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was the writing of &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; that brought
world-wide fame to this unusual mother. The family had
moved from Cincinnati to Brunswick, Maine, where Professor
Stowe had accepted a position in the faculty of Bowdoin
College. There were six children now and the father&rsquo;s
income was meager. In order to help meet the family
expenses, Mrs. Stowe began to write articles for a magazine
<span class="pb" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
known as the &ldquo;National Era.&rdquo; She labored under difficulties.
&ldquo;If I sit by the open fire in the parlor,&rdquo; she wrote,
&ldquo;my back freezes, if I sit in my bedroom and try to write
my head and my feet are cold.... I can earn four hundred
dollars a year by writing, but I don&rsquo;t want to feel that I
must, and when weary with teaching the children, and
tending the baby, and buying provisions, and mending dresses,
and darning stockings, I sit down and write a piece for
some paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passage of the Fugitive Slave Act aroused the deepest
feeling among Abolitionists in the North. While living in
Cincinnati her family had aided the so-called &ldquo;underground
railway,&rdquo; by which runaway slaves were helped in their
efforts to reach the Canadian boundary. Now Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s
spirit burned within her. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she writes at this period,
&ldquo;some Martin Luther would arise to set this community
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then she conceived the idea of writing &ldquo;Uncle
Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.&rdquo; In the month of February, 1851, while
attending communion service in the college church at Brunswick,
the scene of the death of Uncle Tom passed before
her mind like the unfolding of a vision. When she returned
home she immediately wrote down the mental picture she
had seen. Then she gathered her children around her and
read what she had written. Two of them broke into violent
weeping, the first of many thousands who have wept
over &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first chapter was not completed until the following
April, and on June 5 it began to appear in serial form in
the &ldquo;National Era.&rdquo; She had intended to write a short
tale of a few chapters, but as her task progressed the conviction
grew on her that she had been intrusted with a holy
<span class="pb" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
mission. Afterwards she said: &ldquo;I could not control the
story; it wrote itself.&rdquo; At another time she remarked:
&ldquo;The Lord himself wrote it, and I was but the humblest
of instruments in His hand. To Him alone should be given
all the praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stowe received $300 for her serial story! However,
scarcely had the last instalment appeared when a
Boston publisher made arrangements to print it in book
form. Within one year it had passed through 120 editions,
and four months after the book was off the press the author
had received $10,000 in royalties. Almost in a day Mrs.
Stowe had become one of the most famous women in the
world, and the specter of poverty had been banished forever.
&ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; exerted a profound influence not
only over the American people, but its fame spread to
Europe. The year following its publication Jenny Lind
came to America. Asked to contribute to a fund Mrs. Stowe
was raising for the purpose of purchasing the freedom of a
slave family, the &ldquo;Swedish Nightingale&rdquo; gladly responded,
also writing a letter to Mrs. Stowe in the following prophetic
vein: &ldquo;I have the feeling about &lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rsquo;
that great changes will take place by and by, from the impression
people receive from it, and that the writer of that
book can fall asleep today or tomorrow with the bright,
sweet consciousness of having been a strong means in the
Creator&rsquo;s hand of having accomplished essential good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tributes like this came to Mrs. Stowe from the great
and lowly in all parts of the world.</p>
<p>Concerning Jenny Lind&rsquo;s singing, Mrs. Stowe wrote to
her husband from New York: &ldquo;Well, we have heard Jenny
Lind, and the affair was a bewildering dream of sweetness
and beauty. Her face and movements are full of poetry
<span class="pb" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
and feeling. She has the artless grace of a little child, the
poetic effect of a wood-nymph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stowe died in 1896 at the ripe age of eighty-four.
Not long before her death she wrote to a friend: &ldquo;I have
sometimes had in my sleep strange perceptions of a vivid
spiritual life near to and with Christ, and multitudes of
holy ones, and the joy of it is like no other joy&mdash;it cannot
be told in the language of the world.... The inconceivable
loveliness of Christ!... I was saying as I awoke:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis joy enough, my All in all,</p>
<p class="t">At Thy dear feet to lie.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt not let me lower fall,</p>
<p class="t">And none can higher fly.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div id="c71" title="A Hymn Written on Two Shores">
<div class="pb" id="Page_407">[407]</div>
<h3>A HYMN WRITTEN ON TWO SHORES</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Saviour, sprinkle many nations&rdquo; has been called
the &ldquo;loveliest of missionary hymns.&rdquo; The praise
is scarcely too great. All the elements that make
a great hymn are present here. Scriptural in language and
devotional in spirit, it is fervent and touching in its appeal
and exquisitely beautiful in poetic expression. It was given
to the Church by Arthur Cleveland Coxe, an American
bishop, in 1851, and since that time it has made its victorious
course around the world.</p>
<p>A study of the hymn is interesting. The first stanza at
once suggests the words of Jesus, uttered in the last week
of His life, when Greek pilgrims in Jerusalem came seeking
for Him: &ldquo;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will
draw all men unto me.&rdquo; In the second stanza the author no
doubt had in mind the immortal words of St. Augustine:
&ldquo;Thou, O Lord, hast made me for Thyself, and my heart
can find no rest till it rest in Thee.&rdquo; And in the final
stanza we find almost an echo of the thought expressed by
Paul in Romans: &ldquo;How then shall they call on him in
whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe
in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they
hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except
they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the
feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad
tidings of good things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously enough, this beautiful missionary lyric was
written on two shores of the Atlantic. It was on Good
Friday, in the year 1850, that the first stanza was written
<span class="pb" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
by Bishop Coxe at his home in Hartford, Conn. For lack
of time, however, or because the needed inspiration did not
come to him the unfinished manuscript was laid aside.</p>
<p>The next year he visited England, and one day, while
wandering about the campus of Magdalen College, Oxford,
the thought flashed through his mind that he had never
completed the hymn. Finding a scrap of paper and a pencil,
he sat down to write, and in a few moments the touching
words of the two concluding stanzas were composed, and the
hymn was sent on its way to stir the heart of the world.</p>
<p>Bishop Coxe was not primarily a hymn-writer. His fame
rests chiefly on his religious ballads. It was in 1840, when
a young student of twenty-two, that he published his first
volume, entitled &ldquo;Christian Ballads.&rdquo; These are mostly
moral poems, impressive and challenging in character, but
not usually suitable as hymns. One of them, however, bearing
the name of &ldquo;Chelsea,&rdquo; has yielded the famous hymn,
&ldquo;O where are kings and empires now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interesting story is told concerning this hymn. In
1873 the General Conference of the Evangelical Alliance
was held in New York City. It was a period when many
scientific objections had been raised regarding the value of
prayer, and many anxious souls were fearful that the faith
of the Church was being shaken to its foundations. President
Woolsey of Yale University gave the opening address.
After he had referred to the wave of skepticism that had
swept over the world, particularly in regard to prayer, he
looked out upon the assembly with a quiet, confident smile
lighting his features, and then quoted the first stanza of
Bishop Coxe&rsquo;s hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O where are kings and empires now,</p>
<p class="t">Of old that went and came?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_409">[409]</div>
<p class="t0">But, Lord, Thy church is praying yet,</p>
<p class="t">A thousand years the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a moment,&rdquo; writes an eye-witness, &ldquo;there was silence.
In another moment the full significance of the reference
had flashed on every mind, and the response was
instantaneous and universal. Shouts, waving of handkerchiefs,
clapping of hands, stamping of feet&mdash;I never knew anything
like it. Round after round continued, until the storm of
applause ended in a burst of grateful tears. No one
doubted that the Church still believed in prayer and that
the tempest had passed without the loss of a sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same volume of &ldquo;Christian Ballads&rdquo; there appears
another little poem, most appealing in its simplicity:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the silent midnight-watches,</p>
<p class="t">List&mdash;thy bosom door!</p>
<p class="t0">How it knocketh, knocketh, knocketh,</p>
<p class="t">Knocketh, evermore!</p>
<p class="t0">Say not &rsquo;tis thy pulse is beating:</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis thy heart of sin;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis thy Saviour knocks, and crieth,</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;Rise, and let Me in!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For a time Coxe gave promise of becoming the &ldquo;John
Keble of America,&rdquo; but after his election as a bishop in the
Episcopal Church, pressing duties interfered with his literary
work, and in later years he wrote few poems.</p>
<p>Bishop Coxe was the son of a noted Presbyterian minister,
Rev. Samuel H. Cox. He was born in Menham, N. J.,
in 1818. After his graduation from the University of the
City of New York, he decided to leave the Presbyterian
Church and to enter the Episcopalian fold. At the same
time he added an &ldquo;e&rdquo; to the end of his name, much to his father&rsquo;s
displeasure! He died in 1896 at the age of seventy-eight years.</p>

<h3>A HYMN THAT GREW OUT OF SUFFERING</h3>
<p>The fruits of a sanctified life are often seen long after
the person who lived that life has ceased from earthly
strivings. This was true in a very special sense
of Elizabeth Payson Prentiss, author of &ldquo;More love to
Thee, O Christ.&rdquo; Although it is fifty years since Mrs.
Prentiss went home to glory, her beautiful Christian life
still radiates its spirit of trust and hope through her hymns
and devotional writings.</p>
<p>As a child she was blessed with an unusual home. Her
father, Edward Payson, was one of New England&rsquo;s most
famous clergymen, revered and beloved by thousands because
of his saintly life. It is said that after his death the
name of &ldquo;Edward Payson&rdquo; was given in baptism to thousands
of children whose parents had been blessed through
his consecrated ministry.</p>
<p>The daughter, who was born in 1818, was much like
her father. Spiritually minded from childhood, she possessed
unusual gifts as a writer. When she was only sixteen
years old she contributed verses and prose to &ldquo;The
Youth&rsquo;s Companion.&rdquo; Later she taught school at Portland,
Me., her birthplace, and in Ipswich, Mass., and Richmond,
Va., at each place being greatly beloved by her pupils.</p>
<p>In 1845 she became the bride of Rev. George L. Prentiss,
who later was a professor in Union Theological Seminary,
New York City.</p>
<p>Her home life was beautiful. Those who knew her best,
<span class="pb" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
described her as &ldquo;a very bright-eyed little woman, with a
keen sense of humor, who cared more to shine in her own
happy household than in a wide circle of society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all the while she was carrying a heavy burden.
Throughout life she was a sufferer, and scarcely knew what
it meant to be well. Chronic insomnia added to her afflictions,
but as her body languished under physical chastening
her spirit rose above pain and tribulation, daily growing
more radiant and beautiful. It was out of these trying
experiences that she wrote her famous story, &ldquo;Stepping
Heavenward.&rdquo; The purpose of the book, as she herself
explained, was &ldquo;for strengthening and comforting other
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It met with instant success, more than 200,000 copies
being sold. It also was translated into many foreign languages.
Another story, &ldquo;The Flower of the Family,&rdquo; likewise
became very popular.</p>
<p>It was as poet and hymn-writer, however, that Mrs. Prentiss
was destined to achieve fame. Her volume, &ldquo;Religious
Poems,&rdquo; numbering one hundred and twenty-three, breathes
a spirit of fervent devotion to Christ. &ldquo;To love Christ
more,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the deepest need, the constant cry of
my soul.... Out in the woods, and on my bed, and out
driving, when I am happy and busy, and when I am sad
and idle, the whisper keeps going up for more love, more
love, more love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is easy to understand how such a longing should finally
find expression in her most famous hymn, &ldquo;More love to
Thee, O Christ.&rdquo; The hymn in reality was the prayer of
her life. It was born in 1856 during a time of great
physical suffering and spiritual anxiety. It was written in
great haste, and the last stanza was left incompleted. Not
<span class="pb" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
until thirteen years later did Mrs. Prentiss show it to her
husband. She then added a final line with a pencil and
gave it to the printer, intending it only for private distribution.
The following year, however, the &ldquo;Great Revival&rdquo;
swept over America, and the hymn sprang into popularity
everywhere.</p>
<p>When in August, 1878, the mortal remains of the sanctified
singer were lowered into the grave, a company of
intimate friends stood with bared heads and sang &ldquo;More
love to Thee, O Christ.&rdquo; The whole Christian world
seemed to join in mourning her death. From far-off China
came a message of sympathy to the bereaved husband in
the form of a fan on which Christian Chinese had inscribed
the famous hymn in native characters.</p>
<p>After her death the following verse was found written
on the flyleaf of one of her favorite books:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One hour with Jesus! How its peace outweighs</p>
<p class="t0">The ravishment of earthly love and praise;</p>
<p class="t0">How dearer far, emptied of self to lie</p>
<p class="t0">Low at His feet, and catch, perchance, His eye,</p>
<p class="t0">Alike content when He may give or take,</p>
<p class="t0">The sweet, the bitter, welcome for His sake.</p>

<div id="c73" title="A Famous Hymn Written for Sailors">
<div class="pb" id="Page_415">[415]</div>
<h3>A FAMOUS HYMN WRITTEN FOR SAILORS</h3>
<p>It does not surprise us that the writer of &ldquo;Jesus, Saviour,
pilot me&rdquo; was the pastor of a sailors&rsquo; church.
Rev. Edward Hopper, who for many years was minister
of the Church of Sea and Land in New York harbor,
had in mind the daily life of the seamen attending his church
when he wrote his famous lyric. A hymn on the theme of
the stormy sea, picturing Jesus as the divine Pilot&mdash;this, he
felt, would appeal to sailors and be a source of constant comfort
and encouragement.</p>
<p>Perhaps Hopper got his idea from Charles Wesley. It
was a common practice of the great English hymn-writer to
compose hymns that were particularly adapted to the audiences
he addressed. When he visited the men who worked
in the Portland quarries in England, he wrote the hymn containing
the lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Strike with the hammer of Thy Word,</p>
<p class="t">And break these hearts of stone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In any event, Hopper&rsquo;s beautiful hymn at once sprang into
popular use, not only with sailors, but with Christians everywhere.
It appeared for the first time anonymously in &ldquo;The
Sailors&rsquo; Magazine,&rdquo; but several hymn-books adopted it. It
was not until 1880, nine years after it was published, however,
that the author&rsquo;s name became known. In that year
the anniversary of the Seamen&rsquo;s Friend Society was held in
Broadway Tabernacle, New York City, and Hopper was
<span class="pb" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
asked to write a hymn for the occasion. He responded by
producing &ldquo;Jesus, Saviour, pilot me,&rdquo; and the secret was out.</p>
<p>Hopper wrote several other hymns, but only this one has
lived. Like Edward Perronet, the author of &ldquo;All hail the
power of Jesus&rsquo; Name,&rdquo; he was &ldquo;a bird of a single song.&rdquo;
We could have wished that the fires of inspired genius had
continued to burn with both of these men. Here, however,
apply the words: &ldquo;Happy is the man who can produce one
song which the world will keep on singing after its author
shall have passed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of &ldquo;Jesus, Saviour, pilot me&rdquo; was a child of
the city. He was born in America&rsquo;s great metropolis, New
York City, in the year 1818. His father was a merchant.
His mother was a descendant of the Huguenots, the persecuted
French Protestants. He was educated for the ministry,
and, after serving several churches in other places, he returned
to New York in 1870 to begin his work among the
men who go down to the sea in ships. He remained as pastor
of the Church of Sea and Land until his death in 1888,
and we scarcely need to add that his ministry was singularly
successful.</p>
<p>The beautiful prayer in the third stanza of Hopper&rsquo;s hymn
was answered in his own passing. He was sitting in his
study-chair, pencil in hand, when the final summons came.
On the sheet before him were found some freshly written
lines on &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo; Thus was fulfilled in his own death
the beautiful prayer expressed in the final stanza of his
hymn:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_417">[417]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When at last I near the shore,</p>
<p class="t0">And the fearful breakers roar</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twixt me and the peaceful rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Then, while leaning on Thy breast,</p>
<p class="t0">May I hear Thee say to me,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Fear not, I will pilot thee.&rdquo;</p>

<div id="c74" title="A Tragedy That Inspired a Great Hymn">
<div class="pb" id="Page_419">[419]</div>
<h3>A TRAGEDY THAT INSPIRED A GREAT HYMN</h3>
<p>The Christian Church has many stirring rally hymns,
but none that is more effective when sung by a large
assembly than George Duffield&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stand up, stand up
for Jesus.&rdquo; Who has not been moved to the depths of his
soul by the inspiring words and resounding music of this
unusual hymn?</p>
<p>A tragedy lies in its background. It was in the year 1858,
and a great spiritual awakening was gripping the city of
Philadelphia. Men referred to this revival afterwards as
&ldquo;the work of God in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most earnest and zealous leaders in the movement
was a young pastor, Dudley A. Tyng, not quite thirty
years old. Because of his evangelical convictions and his
strong opposition to slavery he had shortly before been
compelled to resign as rector of the Church of the Epiphany,
and in 1857 he had organized a little congregation that met
in a public hall.</p>
<p>In the midst of the revival in 1858 he preached a powerful
sermon at a noon-day meeting in Jayne&rsquo;s Hall to a gathering
of 5,000 men. His text was Exodus 10:11: &ldquo;Go
now, ye that are men, and serve the Lord.&rdquo; It is said that
the effect was overwhelming, no less than a thousand men
giving themselves to the Lord.</p>
<p>A few weeks later the young pastor was watching a corn-shelling
machine when his arm was caught in the machinery
and terribly mangled. Though every effort was made to
<span class="pb" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
save his life, he died within a few hours. Shortly before the
end came he cried to the friends who were gathered about
him, &ldquo;Sing, sing, can you not sing?&rdquo; He himself then began
the words of &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; with the others trying to
join him in the midst of their grief. When his father, the
distinguished clergyman, Stephen H. Tyng, bent over him
to ask if he had a last message for his friends, the dying soldier
of the cross whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to stand up for Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rev. George Duffield, also of Philadelphia and a close
friend of the greatly lamented Tyng, felt that the words
were too impressive to be lost. On the following Sunday he
preached a sermon in his own church on Ephesians 6:14,
&ldquo;Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth,
and having on the breastplate of righteousness.&rdquo; As he concluded
his sermon, he read the words of a poem he had written,
&ldquo;Stand up, stand up for Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only did Duffield preserve the dying words of his devoted
friend, but it will be noted that the second stanza also
contains the challenge of Tyng&rsquo;s last revival sermon: &ldquo;Go
now, ye that are men, and serve the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superintendent of Duffield&rsquo;s Sunday school printed
the words of the poem for distribution among his scholars.
One of these leaflets found its way to a religious periodical,
where it was published. Soon it began to appear in hymn-books,
being generally set to a tune composed by George J.
Webb a few years earlier. It is said that the first time the
author heard it sung outside of his own church was in 1864,
when the Christian men in the Army of the James sang it in
their camp, just before they were about to enter into a bloody
battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_421">[421]</div>
<p>As originally written, the hymn contained six stanzas.
The second and fifth are omitted from most hymn-books.
These stanzas read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stand up, stand up for Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">The solemn watchword hear;</p>
<p class="t0">If while ye sleep He suffers,</p>
<p class="t">Away with shame and fear;</p>
<p class="t0">Where&rsquo;er ye meet with evil,</p>
<p class="t">Within you or without,</p>
<p class="t0">Charge for the God of Battles,</p>
<p class="t">And put the foe to rout.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stand up, stand up for Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">Each soldier to his post:</p>
<p class="t0">Close up the broken column,</p>
<p class="t">And shout through all the host:</p>
<p class="t0">Make good the loss so heavy,</p>
<p class="t">In those that still remain,</p>
<p class="t0">And prove to all around you</p>
<p class="t">That death itself is gain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The omission of these lines is really no loss, since they
sink far beneath the literary level of the remaining verses.
They also carry the military imagery to needless length.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_423">[423]</div>
<h3>ANNA WARNER AND HER BEAUTIFUL HYMNS</h3>
<p>In the last week of our Saviour&rsquo;s life, a very beautiful
and touching incident occurred in the city of Jerusalem.
The Evangelist John tells the story in the
following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there were certain Greeks among those that went
up to worship at the feast: these therefore came to Philip,
who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying,
Sir, we would see Jesus. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew:
Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus. And Jesus
answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
of man should be glorified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the petition of these Gentile pilgrims from the land
of the Spartans and Athenians that inspired an American
young woman to write one of our beautiful hymns, &ldquo;We
would see Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her name was Anna Bartlett Warner, and for almost a
century she lived at a beautiful retreat in the Hudson river
known as Constitution island, under the very shadows of the
great military academy at West Point. She had a sister
named Susan who achieved even greater literary fame than
she, but it is Anna&rsquo;s name, after all, that will live on and be
cherished for her songs. We wonder if any child in America
during the last half century has not learned to know and
to love the little hymn&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus loves me, this I know,</p>
<p class="t0">For the Bible tells me so.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_424">[424]</div>
<p>Children throughout the world are singing it now, and
missionaries tell us that the simplicity of its message also
makes a wonderful appeal to the newly-converted heathen.
This hymn is one of the reasons why the name of Anna Warner
will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>An exquisite lullaby, also written by Miss Warner, begins
with the words, &ldquo;O little child, lie still and sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two volumes of sacred song were composed by this gifted
young woman. The first bore the title, &ldquo;Hymns of the
Church Militant,&rdquo; and was published in 1858. The second,
called &ldquo;Wayfaring Hymns, Original and Translated,&rdquo; appeared
in 1869. &ldquo;We would see Jesus&rdquo; was included in the
first of these collections. It appears, however, that it was
written at least seven years before its publication. An interesting
item from her sister Susan&rsquo;s diary, under date of
February 8, 1851, tells of the impression the hymn made on
her when she first read it. She writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day, Sunday, in the afternoon, Anna had been
copying off some hymns for Emmelin&rsquo;s book, and left them
with me to look over. I had not read two verses of &lsquo;We
would see Jesus,&rsquo; when I thought of Anna, and merely casting
my eye down, the others so delighted and touched me
that I left it for tears and petitions. I wished Anna might
prove the author&mdash;and after I found she was, I sat by her
a little while with my head against her, crying such delicious
tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another hymn that has found a place in many hearts bears
the title, &ldquo;The Song of the Tired Servant.&rdquo; It was inspired
by a letter received by Miss Warner from a friend who was
a pastor, in which he spoke of the weariness he felt after the
tasks of an arduous day, but of the joy that his soul experienced
in serving the Master. The first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_425">[425]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">One more day&rsquo;s work for Jesus,</p>
<p class="t0">One less of life for me!</p>
<p class="t">But heaven is nearer,</p>
<p class="t">And Christ is dearer</p>
<p class="t0">Than yesterday, to me;</p>
<p class="t">His love and light</p>
<p class="t">Fill all my soul tonight.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although the two Warner sisters lived in a corner apart
from the busy world, they made their influence felt in widespread
circles. They felt a particular responsibility in reference
to the many thousands of young men from all parts
of the United States who were being trained at West Point
for service in the army, and for many years they conducted
a Bible class for the cadets.</p>
<p>Military honors were accorded each of the sisters when
they were buried. Anna Warner was ninety-five years old
when she died in 1915.</p>

<h3>PHILLIPS BROOKS AND HIS CAROLS</h3>
<p>Phillips Brooks was a great man. Not only
was he a giant in stature, but he possessed a great
mind and a great heart. Also, he was a great
preacher&mdash;one of America&rsquo;s greatest&mdash;and he just missed being
a great poet. Indeed, the flashes of poetic genius revealed
in the few verses he wrote indicate that he might have
become famous as a hymn-writer had he chosen such a career.</p>
<p>His poetic gift had its roots in childhood. Phillips was
brought up in a pious New England home. Every Sunday
the children of the Brooks household were required to memorize
a hymn, and, when the father conducted the evening
devotion on the Lord&rsquo;s day, the children recited their hymns.
When Phillips was ready to go to college, he could repeat
no less than two hundred hymns from memory. In his later
ministry this knowledge proved to be of inestimable value,
and he frequently made effective use of hymn quotations in
his preaching. But, more than that, the childhood training
unconsciously had made of him a poet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O little town of Bethlehem,&rdquo; his most famous Christmas
carol, was written for a Sunday school Christmas festival in
1868, when Brooks was rector of Holy Trinity Episcopal
Church in Philadelphia. He was only thirty-two years old
at the time. Three years earlier he had visited the Holy
Land, and on Christmas eve he had stood on the star-lit hills
where the shepherds had watched their flocks. Below the
hills he had seen the &ldquo;little town of Bethlehem,&rdquo; slumbering
<span class="pb" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
in the darkness just as it had done in the night when Jesus
was born. Later he had attended midnight services in the
Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>He could never entirely forget the impressions of that
sublime night, and, when he was asked in 1868 to write a
Christmas hymn for his Sunday school, he put down on paper
the song that long had been ringing in his mind.</p>
<p>The beautiful tune &ldquo;St. Louis,&rdquo; to which the hymn is
usually sung, also has an interesting story. It was composed
by Lewis H. Redner, who was organist and Sunday school
superintendent of Dr. Brooks&rsquo; church. When Brooks asked
Redner to write a suitable tune for the words, the latter
waited for the inspiration that never seemed to come. Christmas
eve arrived and Redner went to sleep without having
written the tune. In the middle of the night, however, he
dreamed that he heard angels singing. He awoke with the
melody still sounding in his ears. Quickly he seized a piece
of paper, and jotted it down, and next morning he filled in
the harmony.</p>
<p>Redner always insisted that the hymn tune was &ldquo;a gift
from heaven,&rdquo; and those who have learned to love its exquisite
strains are more than willing to believe it!</p>
<p>Phillips Brooks, though he never had a family of his own,
possessed a boundless love for children. That, perhaps, is
one reason why the Christmas season so fascinated him, and
why he wrote so many Christmas carols for children. One
of these is famous for its striking refrain, &ldquo;Everywhere,
everywhere, Christmas tonight.&rdquo; &ldquo;The voice of the Christ-child&rdquo;
is the title of another Christmas carol. He also
wrote a number of Easter carols, among them, &ldquo;God hath
sent His angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Phillips Brooks not only made a strong appeal to children;
<span class="pb" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
it was not long before the great and learned men of
America began to realize that a great preacher and prophet
had risen among them. There was need of such a spiritual
leader, for Unitarianism had threatened to engulf all New
England.</p>
<p>In its beginnings this movement was merely a protest
against the stern and forbidding aspects of the Christian religion
as it had been exemplified in New England Puritanism.
It grew more and more radical, however, until the
deity of Christ was denied.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned religion of &ldquo;Christ and Him crucified&rdquo;
was all but forgotten in the intellectual circles of New England
when a young man thirty-four years of age began
preaching in Trinity church, Boston. He was preaching Jesus
Christ, but he was presenting Him in a new and wonderful
light. Crowds began to fill the church. Even sedate
old Harvard was stirred.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the ministry of Phillips Brooks
in Boston, a ministry that made him famous throughout the
land. It marked the turning point in religious tendencies in
New England, and perhaps was the most potent factor in
checking the spread of the Unitarian doctrine. Brooks was
later elevated to a bishopric in his Church. He died in 1893.</p>
<p>It is said that when a little girl of five years was told by
her mother that &ldquo;Bishop Brooks has gone to heaven,&rdquo; the
child exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, mamma, how happy the angels will
be!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_431">[431]</div>
<h3>WOMEN WHO WROTE HYMNS FOR CHILDREN</h3>
<p>Everybody loves the hymns the children sing. And
that, perhaps, is the reason why Emily Huntington
Miller&rsquo;s name will not soon be forgotten, for the
hymns she wrote were children&rsquo;s hymns indeed&mdash;hymns that
came from the heart of one who understood the heart of a
child.</p>
<p>The daughter of a Methodist clergyman, Emily Huntington
was born in Brooklyn, Conn., October 22, 1833. The
spiritual and cultural influence of a New England parsonage
was not lost on this little child, who early in life began to
reveal unusual literary gifts. It was very unusual in those
days for young women to attend college, but Emily enrolled
at Oberlin College and graduated in the class of 1857.</p>
<p>Ten years later she became one of the editors of &ldquo;<i>The
Little Corporal</i>,&rdquo; a very popular magazine for children. Each
month she contributed a poem to this publication. Like all
other contributors, she often found it difficult to have her
poem ready each month on the required day. One month
in 1867 she was handicapped by illness. The final day came,
and her poem was not written. In spite of her weakness,
she aroused herself to the task. The inspiration seemed to
come immediately, and, so she tells us, &ldquo;in less than fifteen
minutes the hymn was written and sent away without any
correction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn referred to was &ldquo;I love to hear the story.&rdquo; Almost
immediately it sprang into popularity. In England it
<span class="pb" id="Page_432">[432]</span>
was admitted in 1875 to &ldquo;Hymns Ancient and Modern,&rdquo;
the hymn-book of the Church of England. This was a very
unusual honor, since very few hymns of American origin
have been included in that famous collection. It is said that
no one was more surprised at the popularity achieved by the
hymn than the author herself.</p>
<p>Another of her hymns that has won a place in the hearts
of the smaller children is the sweet little gem:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus bids us shine</p>
<p class="t">With a clear, pure light</p>
<p class="t0">Like a little candle</p>
<p class="t">Burning in the night;</p>
<p class="t0">In the world is darkness,</p>
<p class="t">So we must shine,</p>
<p class="t0">You in your small corner,</p>
<p class="t">And I in mine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another of her hymns for children, though not so well
known as the other two mentioned, possesses unusual merit:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Father, while the shadows fall,</p>
<p class="t0">With the twilight over all,</p>
<p class="t0">Deign to hear my evening prayer,</p>
<p class="t0">Make a little child Thy care.</p>
<p class="t">Take me in Thy holy keeping</p>
<p class="t2">Till the morning break;</p>
<p class="t">Guard me thro&rsquo; the darkness sleeping,</p>
<p class="t2">Bless me when I wake.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Emily Huntington became the wife of Prof. John E.
Miller in 1860. After his death she became dean of the
Woman&rsquo;s College of Northwestern University, in which
position she exerted a blessed influence over large numbers
of young women. She died in 1913.</p>
<p>Another American woman who at this time was also
<span class="pb" id="Page_433">[433]</span>
writing hymns for children was Mrs. Lydia Baxter. Although
born at Petersburg, N. Y., September 2, 1809, it was
not until nearly fifty years later that she seems to have begun
to exercise her gifts as a song writer. Her &ldquo;Gems by
the Wayside&rdquo; were published in 1855, after which she became
a frequent contributor to hymn collections for Sunday
schools and evangelistic services.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baxter may be regarded as one of the forerunners
of the Gospel hymn movement of America. Her lyrics fall
short of the severer standards required in a true hymn, and
for this reason few of her hymns have been admitted to the
authorized collections of the principal church communions.
However, the woman who wrote &ldquo;Take the Name of Jesus
with you&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is a gate that stands ajar&rdquo; will not
soon be forgotten by pious Christians, even though the author
receives scant notice at the hands of hymnologists. It
is a significant fact that in 1921 the Church of Sweden included
a translation of the latter hymn in the appendix to
its &ldquo;Psalm-book,&rdquo; one of the most conservative hymn collections
in Christendom. Mrs. Baxter died in New York,
June 22, 1874.</p>

<div id="c78" title="Fanny Crosby, America&rsquo;s Blind Poet">
<div class="pb" id="Page_435">[435]</div>
<h3>FANNY CROSBY, AMERICA&rsquo;S BLIND POET</h3>
<p>Blindness is not always an affliction. If it serves
to give the soul a clearer vision of Christ and of His
redeeming love, as it did with Fanny Crosby, it may
rather be regarded as a blessing.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s most famous hymn-writer could never remember
having seen the light of day, nevertheless her life was
one of the most happy and fruitful ever lived. Always she
radiated a sweet and cheerful spirit, refusing to be pitied,
while her soul poured out the songs that brought joy and
salvation to countless multitudes.</p>
<p>Born of humble parents at Southeast, N. Y., March 24,
1823, she was only six weeks old when, through the application
of a poultice to her eyes, her sight was forever destroyed.
Such a disaster would have cast a perpetual gloom
over most lives, but not so with Fanny Crosby. Even at
the age of eight years she gave evidence not only of her happy
optimism but also of her poetic genius by penning the following
cheerful lines:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O what a happy soul am I!</p>
<p class="t">Although I cannot see,</p>
<p class="t0">I am resolved that in this world</p>
<p class="t">Contented I will be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How many blessings I enjoy,</p>
<p class="t">That other people don&rsquo;t;</p>
<p class="t0">To weep and sigh because I&rsquo;m blind,</p>
<p class="t">I cannot, and I won&rsquo;t!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_436">[436]</div>
<p>When she was fifteen years old she entered the Institution
for the Blind in New York City, where she soon began
to develop her remarkable talent for writing verse. At
first she wrote only secular songs. One of these, &ldquo;Rosalie,
the Prairie Flower,&rdquo; brought the blind girl nearly $3,000
in royalties.</p>
<p>Strange to state, it was not until she was forty-one years
old that her first hymn was written. It was in 1864 that
she met the famous composer, W. B. Bradbury, and it was
at his request that she made her first attempt at hymn-writing.
Her first hymn began:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We are going, we are going,</p>
<p class="t">To a home beyond the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the fields are robed in beauty,</p>
<p class="t">And the sunlight never dies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She now felt that she had found her real mission in life,
and she wrote that she was &ldquo;the happiest creature in all the
land.&rdquo; Until her death in 1915, hymns flowed from her inspired
pen in a ceaseless stream. For a long time she was under contract
to furnish her publishers, Biglow &amp; Main, with three hymns every
week. It has been estimated that no less than 8,000 hymns and
songs were written by this unusual woman.</p>
<p>Not all of her hymns possess high poetical excellence. In
fact, they have been subjected to the most severe criticism.
John Julian, the English hymnologist, with his usual candor,
declares that &ldquo;they are, with few exceptions, very weak and
poor, their simplicity and earnestness being their redeeming
features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, whether we consider her hymns of high poetic
standard or not, the fact remains that no one has written
<span class="pb" id="Page_437">[437]</span>
more hymns that are being sung and loved today than Fanny
Crosby. Certainly the hymnody of the Christian Church is
infinitely richer for &ldquo;Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet
hour of prayer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Safe in the arms of Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;All the way
my Saviour leads me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus is tenderly calling thee home,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am thine, O Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rescue the perishing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Speed
away,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus keep me
near the Cross,&rdquo; &ldquo;Some day the silver cord will break,&rdquo; and
scores of other inspiring gems that have come to us from
this blind genius.</p>
<p>Practically all her hymns are very subjective in character.
Although this is doubtless an element of weakness, it probably
explains their unusual personal appeal. It was the
prayer of Miss Crosby that she might win a million souls for
Christ, and there are many who believe that her prayer has
been more than realized. A strong Scriptural note is heard
in most of her hymns. When she was yet a child, she committed
to memory the first four books of the Old Testament,
as well as the four Gospels, and this proved a rich treasure
store from which she drew in later life.</p>
<p>Fanny Crosby&rsquo;s fault apparently lay in the fact that she
was too prolific a writer. Most of her songs were composed
in a few minutes. Often the lines came as rapidly as they
could be dictated. It was this circumstance that led Dr. S.
W. Duffield to observe rather facetiously that &ldquo;It is more
to her credit as a writer that she has occasionally found a
pearl than that she has brought to the surface so many oyster
shells.&rdquo; However, before his death he evidently had altered
his opinion, for he wrote: &ldquo;I rather think her talent will
stand beside that of Watts or Wesley, especially if we take
into consideration the number of hymns she has written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly there are many pearls among the 8,000 songs
<span class="pb" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
she wrote, and perhaps none has given more solace to broken
hearts than &ldquo;Safe in the arms of Jesus.&rdquo; Often the themes
of her hymns were suggested to her by publishers or musical
composers. At other times a musician would play a tune
for her and ask her to write words for it. It was in 1868
that William H. Doane, the popular hymn composer, came
to her one day and said: &ldquo;Fanny, I have a tune I would like
to have you hear.&rdquo; He played it for her, and she exclaimed,
&ldquo;That says &lsquo;Safe in the arms of Jesus!&rsquo;&rdquo; She went to her
room immediately, and within half an hour the words had
been written.</p>
<p>Although Fanny Crosby never permitted the fact of her
blindness to make her life gloomy, there are many touching
allusions in her hymns to her affliction. &ldquo;All the way my
Saviour leads me&rdquo; suggests how much a guiding hand means
to the blind. The same thought appears in the song, &ldquo;God
will take care of you,&rdquo; especially in the lines,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tenderly watching, and keeping His own,</p>
<p class="t0">He will not leave you to wander alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There also are pathetic passages in her hymns that reflect
the hope that some day the long night of blindness would
be ended&mdash;in heaven.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here let me wait with patience,</p>
<p class="t">Wait till the night is o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t0">Wait till I see the morning</p>
<p class="t">Break on the golden shore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is also the constant refrain heard in the exquisite
hymn, &ldquo;Some day the silver cord will break.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And I shall see Him face to face,</p>
<p class="t0">And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_439">[439]</div>
<p>Nevertheless, she never permitted any one to express sympathy
on account of her blindness. Once a Scotch minister
remarked to her, &ldquo;I think it is a great pity that the Master,
when He showered so many gifts upon you, did not give you
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered: &ldquo;Do you know that, if at birth I had been
able to make one petition to my Creator, if would have been
that I should be made blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the surprised clergyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, when I get to heaven, the first face that shall
ever gladden my sight will be that of my Saviour,&rdquo; was the
unexpected reply.</p>
<p>At a summer religious conference in Northfield, Mass.,
Miss Crosby was sitting on the platform when the evangelist,
Dwight L. Moody, asked her for a testimony concerning
her Christian experience. At first she hesitated, then quietly
rose and said: &ldquo;There is one hymn I have written which has
never been published. I call it my Soul&rsquo;s poem, and sometimes
when I am troubled I repeat it to myself, for it brings
comfort to my heart.&rdquo; She then recited:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Some day the silver chord will break,</p>
<p class="t">And I no more as now shall sing:</p>
<p class="t0">But, the joy when I shall wake</p>
<p class="t">Within the palace of the King!</p>
<p class="t0">And I shall see Him face to face,</p>
<p class="t0">And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sight of her uplifted face, with its wistful expression,
made a deep impression upon the vast audience, and many
were moved to tears.</p>
<p>In 1858 Miss Crosby married Alexander Van Alstyne,
a blind musician, wherefore she is often referred to as Mrs.
Frances Jane Van Alstyne. She died on February 12, 1915.</p>

<div id="c79" title="One of America&rsquo;s Earliest Gospel Singers">
<div class="pb" id="Page_441">[441]</div>
<h3>ONE OF AMERICA&rsquo;S EARLIEST GOSPEL SINGERS</h3>
<p>Among hymn-books that have exerted a profound influence
over the spiritual lives of Christian people
none has probably achieved greater fame or wider
circulation than the volume known as Gospel Hymns. It
was issued in a series of six editions, but now is usually
found combined in a single book.</p>
<p>Philip P. Bliss, the subject of this chapter, was the first
editor of Gospel Hymns. Associated with him in the publication
of the first two editions was the renowned Ira D.
Sankey, who gained world-wide fame through his evangelistic
campaigns with Dwight L. Moody.</p>
<p>The story of the life of Bliss reads like romance.</p>
<p>Like many a poor lad endowed with love for the artistic,
he was compelled to struggle almost all his life for the
opportunity that finally came to him. Born at Rome, Pa., in
1838, he early revealed a passion for music when, as a boy,
he made crude instruments on which he tried to produce
tones.</p>
<p>The story is told of how Philip, when a ragged and barefoot
boy of ten years, heard piano music for the first time.
So entranced did he become that he entered the home unbidden,
and stood listening at the parlor door. When the
young woman at the instrument ceased playing, the child
who hungered for music cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O lady, play some more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of complying with the request, the startled young
<span class="pb" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
woman is said to have invited young Bliss to leave the house
forthwith!</p>
<p>Although he received practically no musical education,
except from occasional attendance at a singing school, he
wrote his first song at the age of twenty-six years. It was
called &ldquo;Lora Vale,&rdquo; and because of its popular reception,
Bliss was encouraged to devote all his time to writing songs
and giving concerts.</p>
<p>Bliss usually wrote both the words and music of his hymns.
His work was done very quickly, the inspiration for the
whole song, text and melody, being born in his mind at once.</p>
<p>Any incident of an unusually impressive nature would immediately
suggest a theme to his mind. He heard the story
of a shipwreck. The doomed vessel was abandoned, and the
captain ordered the sailors to exert their utmost strength to
&ldquo;pull for the shore.&rdquo; Immediately he wrote his well-known
song with the words as a refrain.</p>
<p>One night he listened to a sermon in which the preacher
closed with the words, &ldquo;He who is almost persuaded is almost
saved, but to be almost saved is to be entirely lost.&rdquo; He
went home from the service and wrote &ldquo;Almost persuaded,&rdquo;
a hymn that is said to have brought more souls to Christ than
anything else Bliss ever composed.</p>
<p>In 1870 he heard Major Whittle, an evangelist, tell the
story of how the message, &ldquo;Hold the fort!&rdquo; was signalled to
the besieged garrison at Allatoona Pass. The words suggested
the passage from Revelations 2:25, &ldquo;That which ye
have, hold fast till I come.&rdquo; The result was one of his most
famous Gospel songs, the chorus of which runs:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hold the fort, for I am coming,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t">Jesus signals still,</p>
<p class="t0">Wave the answer back to heaven,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">&ldquo;By Thy grace we will.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_443">[443]</div>
<p>Other popular songs by Bliss are &ldquo;Whosoever heareth,
shout, shout the sound,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am so glad that our Father in
heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light in the valley,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sing them over
again to me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let the lower lights be burning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Free from
the law, Oh, happy condition,&rdquo; &ldquo;Down life&rsquo;s dark vale we
wander&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where hast thou gleaned today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These songs, like the greater number of the Gospel
Hymns, do not possess high literary merit. The most that
can be said for them is that they are imaginative and picturesque.
They are usually strong in emotional appeal. The
same is true of the tunes composed for them. They are
usually very light in character, with a lilt and movement
that make them easily singable, but lacking in the rich harmony
found in the standard hymns and chorales. No doubt
there will always be a certain demand for this type of religious
song, and a few of the Gospel Hymns will probably
live on, but the present trend in all of the principal Christian
denominations is toward a higher standard of hymnody.</p>
<p>A terrible tragedy brought the life of the Gospel singer to
a close in his thirty-eighth year. He had visited the old
childhood home at Rome, Pa., at Christmas time in 1876,
and was returning to Chicago in company with his wife
when a railroad bridge near Ashtabula, Ohio, collapsed on
the evening of December 29. Their train plunged into a
ravine, sixty feet below, where it caught fire, and one hundred
passengers perished miserably.</p>
<p>Bliss managed to escape from the wreckage, but crawled
back into a window in search for his wife. That was the
last seen of him.</p>
<p>The song-writer&rsquo;s first name was originally &ldquo;Philipp.&rdquo;
He disliked the unusual spelling, however, and in later years
he used the extra &ldquo;P&rdquo; as a middle initial.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_445">[445]</div>
<h3>THE LYRIST OF CHAUTAUQUA</h3>
<p>Those who have had the privilege of attending a vesper
service in the great Chautauqua Institution auditorium
on the shores of beautiful Lake Chautauqua,
N. Y., have come away with at least one impression
that is lasting. It is the singing by the vast assembly of
Mary Lathbury&rsquo;s famous vesper hymn, &ldquo;Day is dying in the
west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This beautiful evening lyric, which was written especially
for the Chautauqua vesper hour, has been called by a distinguished
critic &ldquo;one of the finest and most distinctive
hymns of modern times,&rdquo; and there are few who will not
concur in his judgment.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;lyrist of Chautauqua&rdquo; was born in Manchester, N.
Y., August 10, 1841. As a child she began to reveal artistic
tendencies. She developed a special talent in drawing
pictures of children, and her illustrations in magazines and
periodicals made her name widely known. She also wrote
books and poetry, illustrating them with her own sketches.</p>
<p>Very early in life she felt constrained to dedicate her
talent to Christian service. She tells how she seemed to
hear a voice saying to her: &ldquo;Remember, my child, that you
have a gift of weaving fancies into verse, and a gift with
the pencil of producing visions that come to your heart; consecrate
these to Me as thoroughly and as definitely as you
do your inmost spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An opportunity to serve her Lord in a very definite way
came in 1874, when Dr. John H. Vincent, then secretary of
<span class="pb" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
the Methodist Sunday School Union, employed her as his
assistant. The Chautauqua movement had just been launched
the previous year and the formal opening on the shores of
the beautiful lake from which the institution has received
its name took place on August 4, 1874. Dr. Vincent became
the outstanding leader of the movement, and he began to make
use of Miss Lathbury&rsquo;s literary talent almost immediately.</p>
<p>Dr. Jesse Lyman Hurlbut, historian of Chautauqua,
writes: &ldquo;In Dr. Vincent&rsquo;s many-sided nature was a strain
of poetry, although I do not know that he ever wrote a
verse. Yet he always looked at life and truth through poetic
eyes. Who otherwise would have thought of songs for
Chautauqua and called upon a poet to write them? Dr.
Vincent found in Mary A. Lathbury a poet who could compose
fitting verses for the expression of the Chautauqua
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful evening hymn, &ldquo;Day is dying in the west,&rdquo;
was written in 1880, at Dr. Vincent&rsquo;s request, for the vesper
services which are held every evening. It originally consisted
of only two stanzas, and it was not until ten years
later that Miss Lathbury, at the strong insistence of friends,
added the last two stanzas. We are happy that she did so,
for the last two lines, with their allusion to the &ldquo;eternal
morning&rdquo; when &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; shall end, bring the hymn to a
sublime conclusion.</p>
<p>It was also in 1880 that she wrote another hymn of two
stanzas that has shared in the fame that has come to her evening
hymn. It was composed for the Chautauqua Literary
and Scientific Circle, and Miss Lathbury called it &ldquo;A Study
Song.&rdquo; Its beautiful reference to the Sea of Galilee is made
the more interesting when we are reminded that the hymn
<span class="pb" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
was written on the shores of lovely Lake Chautauqua. The
hymn is particularly adapted for Bible study, and it is said
that the great London preacher, G. Campbell Morgan, always
announced it before his mid-week discourse. The
hymn reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Break Thou the Bread of life,</p>
<p class="t">Dear Lord, to me,</p>
<p class="t0">As Thou didst break the loaves</p>
<p class="t">Beside the sea;</p>
<p class="t0">Beyond the sacred page</p>
<p class="t">I seek Thee, Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">My spirit pants for Thee,</p>
<p class="t">O living Word!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,</p>
<p class="t">To me, to me,</p>
<p class="t0">As Thou didst bless the bread</p>
<p class="t">By Galilee;</p>
<p class="t0">Then shall all bondage cease,</p>
<p class="t">All fetters fall;</p>
<p class="t0">And I shall find my peace,</p>
<p class="t">My All-in-all!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Miss Lathbury was greatly esteemed, not only for her
lovely lyrics which have given inspiration to thousands of
souls, but also for her gentle, Christian character. There
was an indescribable charm about her personality, and she
exerted an abiding influence over those who came in contact
with her devout and consecrated spirit. She died in
New York City in 1913.</p>

<div id="c81" title="Gladden&rsquo;s Hymn of Christian Service">
<div class="pb" id="Page_449">[449]</div>
<h3>GLADDEN&rsquo;S HYMN OF CHRISTIAN SERVICE</h3>
<p>For more than half a century, until his death in 1918,
the name of Washington Gladden was known
throughout the length of the country as one of America&rsquo;s
most distinguished clergymen. A prolific writer, his
books and his magazine contributions were widely read by
the American people.</p>
<p>Like most literary productions, however, his books and
pamphlets have already been largely forgotten. It is only
a little hymn, written on a moment&rsquo;s inspiration, that seems
destined to preserve Gladden&rsquo;s name for posterity. That
hymn is &ldquo;O Master, let me walk with Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author was born in Pottsgrove, Pa., February 11,
1836. After his graduation from Williams College in
1859, he was called as pastor to a Congregational church
in Brooklyn. In 1882 he removed to Columbus, O., where
he remained as pastor until 1914, a period of thirty-two
years.</p>
<p>During these years he exerted a profound influence, not
only over the city of Columbus, but in much wider circles.
Gladden was deeply interested in social service, believing
that it is the duty of the Christian Church to elevate the
masses not only spiritually and morally, but in a social and
economic sense as well. By sermons, lectures and by his
writings, he was ever trying to bring about more cordial
relationship between employer and employee.</p>
<p>Gladden was often the center of a storm of criticism on
<span class="pb" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
the part of those who charged him with liberalism. His
beautiful hymn, written in 1879, seems to be in part an
answer to his critics. It originally consisted of three stanzas
of eight lines each. The second stanza, which was omitted
when the poem was first published as a hymn, indicates how
keenly Gladden felt the condemnation of his opponents:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Master, let me walk with Thee</p>
<p class="t0">Before the taunting Pharisee;</p>
<p class="t0">Help me to bear the sting of spite,</p>
<p class="t0">The hate of men who hide Thy light,</p>
<p class="t0">The sore distrust of souls sincere</p>
<p class="t0">Who cannot read Thy judgments clear,</p>
<p class="t0">The dulness of the multitude,</p>
<p class="t0">Who dimly guess that Thou art good.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dr. Gladden always insisted that he was nothing but a
preacher, and he gloried in his high calling. In spite of
busy pastorates, however, he always found time to give expression
to his literary talent. At one time he was a member
of the editorial staff of the New York Independent.
Later he was an editor of the &ldquo;Sunday Afternoon,&rdquo; a weekly
magazine. It was in this magazine that &ldquo;O Master, let
me walk with Thee&rdquo; was first published.</p>
<p>The writer had no idea of composing a hymn when it
was written, and no one was more surprised than he at its
popularity. He himself agreed that the second stanza
quoted above was not suitable for hymn purposes.</p>
<p>Whatever judgment may be passed on Dr. Gladden&rsquo;s
liberalistic views, it will be agreed that he looked upon
Christianity as an intensely practical thing; and, if he
underestimated the value of Christian dogma, it was because he
emphasized so strongly the necessity of Christian life and
practice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_451">[451]</div>
<p>He was always buoyed up by a hopeful spirit, and he
believed implicitly that the Kingdom of Light was gradually
overcoming the forces of evil. In one of his last sermons,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never doubted that the Kingdom I have always
prayed for is coming; that the gospel I have preached is
true. I believe ... that the nation is being saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of his optimism may be seen reflected in the
words of his hymn.</p>

<div id="c82" title="A Hymn with a Modern Message">
<div class="pb" id="Page_453">[453]</div>
<h3>A HYMN WITH A MODERN MESSAGE</h3>
<p>Among the more recent hymns that have found their
way into the hymn-books of the Christian churches
in America, there is none that enjoys such popularity
and esteem as Frank Mason North&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Where cross
the crowded ways of life.&rdquo; It is a hymn of the highest
order, beautiful in thought and unusually tender in expression.
It is typical of the trend in modern hymns to emphasize
the Church&rsquo;s mission among the lowly and the fallen.</p>
<p>From beginning to end this hymn is a picture of the modern
city with its sins and sorrows and spiritual hunger. We
see the city as the meeting place of all races and tongues;
we hear the din and noise of selfish striving; we behold
the haunts of poverty and sin and wretchedness; we catch
a glimpse of the sufferings of helpless childhood, of woman&rsquo;s
secret griefs and man&rsquo;s ceaseless toil. And all these multitudes
are hungering for Christ!</p>
<p>North has, consciously or unconsciously, made a striking
distinction between mere social service work, which aims
at the alleviation of human need and suffering, and inner
mission work, which seeks to help men spiritually as well
as physically. &ldquo;The cup of water&rdquo; is never to be despised,
but when it is given in Christ&rsquo;s Name it has double value;
for it is Christ Himself, after all, that men need, and it
is only Christ who can truly satisfy. Social service can
never take the place of salvation.</p>
<p>What a beautiful prayer is that contained in the fifth
stanza, where the Master is entreated to &ldquo;tread the city&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
streets again!&rdquo; And then, as a fitting climax to this whole
remarkable poem, comes the triumphant thought expressed
in the final lines of the coming of the New Jerusalem from
above&mdash;&ldquo;the city of our God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>North was well qualified to write such a hymn. He
himself was a child of the city, having been born in America&rsquo;s
greatest metropolis in 1850. His early education,
too, was received in New York City and after his graduation
from Wesleyan University in 1872 he served several congregations
in the city of his birth. In 1892 he was made
Corresponding Secretary of the New York City Church
Extension and Missionary Society and in 1912 he was elected
a Corresponding Secretary of the Methodist Episcopal Board
of Foreign Missions. Thus, almost his whole life has been
devoted to missionary activities at home and abroad.</p>
<p>It was in 1905, in response to a request from the Methodist
hymnal committee, that North wrote his celebrated hymn.
He tells the story in the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life was for long years, both by personal choice, and
official duty, given to the people in all phases of their
community life. New York was to me an open book. I spent
days and weeks and years in close contact with every phase
of the life of the multitudes, and at the morning, noon and
evening hours was familiar with the tragedy, as it always
seemed to me, of the jostling, moving currents of the life
of the people as revealed upon the streets and at great
crossings of the avenues; and I have watched them by the
hour as they passed, by tens of thousands. This is no more
than many another man whose sympathies are with the crowd
and with the eager, unsatisfied folk of the world, has done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I recall it, I came to write the hymn itself at the
suggestion of Professor C. T. Winchester, who, as a member
<span class="pb" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
of the committee on the new hymnal, was struggling with
the fact that we have so few modern missionary hymns.
He said to me one day, &lsquo;Why do you not write us a missionary
hymn?&rsquo; I wrote what was in my thought and feeling....
That it has found its way into so many of the
modern hymnals and by translation into so many of the other
languages, is significant not as to the quality of the hymn
itself but as to the fact that it is an expression of the
tremendous movement of the soul of the gospel in our times which
demands that the follower of Christ must make the interest
of the people his own, and must find the heart of the world&rsquo;s
need if he is in any way to represent his Master among men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another lovely hymn by North was written in 1884.
The first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, the calm that fills my breast</p>
<p class="t">No other heart than Thine can give;</p>
<p class="t0">This peace unstirred, this joy of rest,</p>
<p class="t">None but Thy loved ones can receive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The spirit of this hymn reminds us very much of the
two classic hymns of Bernard of Clairvaux&mdash;&ldquo;O Jesus, joy
of loving hearts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus, the very thought of Thee.&rdquo;
The last line quoted above is evidently inspired by a line
from the latter hymn.</p>

<div id="c83" title="A Lutheran Psalmist of Today">
<div class="pb" id="Page_457">[457]</div>
<h3>A LUTHERAN PSALMIST OF TODAY</h3>
<p>It is gratifying to know that the spirit of hymnody
is not dead, and that still today consecrated men
and women are being inspired to &ldquo;sing new songs
unto Jehovah,&rdquo; In Milwaukee, Wis., lives a young woman
who for several years has been attracting wide-spread attention
by her Christian lyrics. Her name is Anna Hoppe, and
the hymns she writes suggest strongly something of the
style and spirit of the Lutheran hymns of a by-gone age.</p>
<p>Born of German parents in Milwaukee in 1889, she
began to write verse in early childhood. Most of them
were on patriotic themes, such as Washington, Lincoln,
The Battle of Gettysburg, and Paul Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the age of about eleven,&rdquo; Miss Hoppe tells us, &ldquo;I
wrote a few lines on Angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at the age of twenty-five years, however, that she
began in earnest the writing of spiritual poetry. Many
of her poems were published in religious periodicals and
aroused much interest. In the hymnal of the Augustana
Synod, published in 1925, twenty-three of her hymns were
included. Since that time a collection of her hymns under
the title, &ldquo;Songs of the Church Year,&rdquo; has appeared. In
1930 eight of her lyrics were published in the &ldquo;American
Lutheran Hymnal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a prolific writer of hymns, Miss Hoppe probably has
no equal in the Lutheran Church today. Her unusual talent
seems all the more remarkable when it is known that
she is practically self-educated. After she had finished the
eighth grade in the Milwaukee public schools, she entered a
business office. Since that time she has worked continuously,
<span class="pb" id="Page_458">[458]</span>
and has received the benefit of only a few months&rsquo;
training at evening schools. At present she is employed in
the office of the Westinghouse Company.</p>
<p>Her hymns are composed in the midst of the stress and
hurry of modern life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of my hymns,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;have been written
on my way to and from church, and to and from work. I
utilize my lunch hours for typing the hymns and keeping
up correspondence. I used to do quite a bit of writing on
Sunday afternoons, but now we have a Layman&rsquo;s Hour in
our church at that time, and I do not like to miss it. I
also attend our Fundamentalist Bible lectures, Jewish mission
meetings, and the like. Still I find a minute here
and there in which to jot down some verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although few of Miss Hoppe&rsquo;s hymns rise to heights of
poetic rapture, they are characterized by a warmth of feeling
and fervency of spirit that make them true lyrics. They
are thoroughly Scriptural in language, although they sometimes
become too dogmatic in phraseology. A deep certainty
of faith, however, breathes through their lines and
saves them from becoming prosaic.</p>
<p>One of her most beautiful hymns is for New Year&rsquo;s. Its
opening stanza reads:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, O precious Name,</p>
<p class="t">By heaven&rsquo;s herald spoken,</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, O holy Name,</p>
<p class="t">Of love divine the token.</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, in Thy dear Name</p>
<p class="t">This new year we begin;</p>
<p class="t0">Bless Thou its opening door,</p>
<p class="t">Inscribe Thy Name within.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A hymn for Epiphany reflects something of the same spirit
of adoration:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_459">[459]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Desire of every nation,</p>
<p class="t">Light of the Gentiles, Thou!</p>
<p class="t0">In fervent adoration</p>
<p class="t">Before Thy throne we bow;</p>
<p class="t0">Our hearts and tongues adore Thee,</p>

<p class="t0">Like incense sweet before Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Permit our songs to rise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The final stanza of her Ascension hymn is full of poetic
fire:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ascend, dear Lord!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou Lamb for sinners slain,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou blest High Priest, ascend!</p>

<p class="t0">Thy kingdom hath no end.</p>

<p class="t0">While angels lift in song their voices.</p>
<p class="t0">Ascend, dear Lord!</p>

<p>Her fidelity to Scriptural language may be seen in the

<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">

<p>Miss Hoppe speaks in glowing terms of the spiritual
impressions received in childhood from pious parents and
a consecrated pastor, the sainted John Bading, who both
baptized and confirmed her. Her father died in 1910.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very pious Lutheran,&rdquo; she writes, &ldquo;and so is
mother. They often spoke of afternoon prayer meetings
they attended in Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of her hymns not already mentioned are, &ldquo;By nature
deaf to things divine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heavenly Sower, Thou hast scattered,&rdquo;
&ldquo;How blest are they who through the power,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord
Jesus Christ, the children&rsquo;s Friend,&rdquo; &ldquo;O dear Redeemer,
crucified,&rdquo; &ldquo;O precious Saviour, heal and bless,&rdquo; &ldquo;O&rsquo;er Jerusalem
Thou weepest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Precious Child, so sweetly sleeping,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Repent, the Kingdom draweth nigh,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sower
goeth forth to sow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou camest down from heaven on
high,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou hast indeed made manifest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou Lord of
life and death,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou virgin-born incarnate Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;O
Lord, my God, Thy holy law,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus, Thine unbounded
love,&rdquo; &ldquo;He did not die in vain,&rdquo; &ldquo;I open wide the portals
of my heart,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rise, my soul, to watch and pray,&rdquo; &ldquo;O joyful
message, sent from heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Thou who once in Galilee,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Thou goest to Jerusalem.&rdquo; She is the translator
of &ldquo;O precious thought! some day the mist shall vanish,&rdquo;
a hymn from the Swedish, as well as some eighty gems
<span class="pb" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
from German hymnody. Thirty-two of her German translations
appeared in &ldquo;The Selah Song Book,&rdquo; edited by
Adolf T. Hanser in 1922.</p>
<p>Many of Miss Hoppe&rsquo;s hymns have been written on the
pericopes of the Church Year. She has consistently refused
to have her hymns copyrighted, believing that no hindrance
should be put in the way of any one who desires to use them.</p>
<p>Up to 1930 nearly 400 hymns had appeared from Miss
Hoppe&rsquo;s pen. Her ambition is to write a thousand original
Christian lyrics.</p>

<div id="c84" title="Survey of American Lutheran Hymnody">
<div class="pb" id="Page_463">[463]</div>
<h3>SURVEY OF AMERICAN LUTHERAN HYMNODY</h3>
<p>It is a significant fact that the first Lutheran pastor
to be ordained in America was a hymn-writer. He
was Justus Falckner, author of the stirring hymn,
&ldquo;Rise, ye children of salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Falckner, who was born on November 22, 1672, in
Langenreinsdorf, Saxony, was the son of a Lutheran pastor
at that place. He entered the University of Halle in 1693
as a student of theology under Francke, but for conscientious
reasons refused to be ordained upon the completion of his
studies. Together with his brother Daniel he became associated
with the William Penn colony in America and arranged
for the sale of 10,000 acres of land to Rev. Andreas
Rudman, who was the spiritual leader of the Swedish
Lutherans along the Delaware.</p>
<p>Through Rudman&rsquo;s influence Falckner was induced to
enter the ministry, and on November 24, 1703, he was ordained
in Gloria Dei Lutheran Church at Wicacoa, Philadelphia.
The ordination service was carried out by the Swedish
Lutheran pastors, Rudman, Erik Bj&ouml;rk, and Andreas
Sandel. Falckner was the first German Lutheran pastor in
America, and he also had the distinction of building the first
German Lutheran church in the New World&mdash;at Falckner&rsquo;s
Swamp, New Hanover, Pa. Later he removed to New York,
where for twenty years he labored faithfully among the
German, Dutch, and Scandinavian settlers in a parish that
<span class="pb" id="Page_464">[464]</span>
extended some two hundred miles from Albany to Long
Island.</p>
<p>It seems that Falckner&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Rise, ye children of salvation,&rdquo;
was written while he was a student at Halle. It
appeared as early as 1697 in &ldquo;Geistreiches Gesangbuch,&rdquo; and
in 1704 it was given a place in Freylinghausen&rsquo;s hymn-book.
There is no evidence that Falckner ever translated it into
English.</p>
<p>Since the Lutheran Church in America to a large extent
employed the German and Scandinavian languages in its
worship, it was content for nearly two hundred years to
depend on hymn-books originating in the Old World. Not
until the latter half of the nineteenth century were serious
efforts made to provide Lutheran hymn-books in the English
language. Writers of original hymns were few in number,
but a number of excellent translators appeared.</p>
<p>Through the efforts of these translators, an increasing
number of Lutheran hymns from the rich store of German
and Scandinavian hymnody are being introduced in the
hymn-books of this country. Pioneers in this endeavor about
half a century ago were Charles Porterfield Krauth, noted
theologian and vice-provost of the University of Pennsylvania;
Joseph A. Seiss, of Philadelphia, pastor and author,
to whom we are indebted for the translation of &ldquo;Beautiful
Saviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winter reigns o&rsquo;er many a region&rdquo;; and
Charles William Schaeffer, Philadelphia theologian, who
translated Held&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come, O come, Thou quickening Spirit&rdquo;
and Rambach&rsquo;s beautiful baptism hymn, &ldquo;Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Mrs. Harriet Krauth Spaeth also belongs to
this group, her most notable contribution being the translation
of the medieval Christian hymn, &ldquo;Behold, a Branch
is growing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_465">[465]</div>
<p>Later translators of German hymns were Matthias Loy,
for many years president of Capital University, Columbus,
Ohio; August Crull, professor of German at Concordia
College, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Conrad H. L. Schuette,
professor of theology at Capital University and later president
of the Joint Synod of Ohio. Loy was not only a translator
but also an author of no mean ability. Among his
original hymns that seem destined to live are &ldquo;Jesus took the
babes and blessed them,&rdquo; &ldquo;I thank Thee, Jesus, for the
grief,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O great High Priest, forget not me.&rdquo; His
splendid translations include such hymns as Selnecker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let
me be Thine forever,&rdquo; Schenck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Now our worship sweet
is o&rsquo;er&rdquo; and Hiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;God in human flesh appearing.&rdquo; From
Schuette we have received in English dress Behm&rsquo;s &ldquo;O holy,
blessed Trinity,&rdquo; while Crull&rsquo;s most successful translations
are Homburg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Where wilt Thou go, since night draws
near?&rdquo; and Ludaemilia Elizabeth of Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt&rsquo;s
beautiful hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, Jesus, Jesus only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the living translators of German hymns, H.
Brueckner, professor at Hebron College, Hebron, Nebraska,
takes first rank. In the American Lutheran Hymnal, published
in 1930 by a Lutheran intersynodical committee, he is
represented by some seventy translations from the German,
three from the French, and four original hymns. Although
Brueckner&rsquo;s work is too recent to be properly evaluated, his
hymns reveal evidences of genuine lyrical quality and true
devotional spirit.</p>
<p>Other successful translators of German hymns are John
Caspar Mattes, Lutheran pastor at Scranton, Pa.; Emmanuel
Cronenwett, pastor emeritus at Butler, Pa., and Paul E.
Kretzmann, of Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Mo., Lutheran
theologian and commentator. To Mattes we are indebted
<span class="pb" id="Page_466">[466]</span>
for the English version of Gotter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Friend of the weary,
O refresh us&rdquo; and Albinus&rsquo; &ldquo;Smite us not in anger, Lord.&rdquo;
Cronenwett and Kretzmann have written a number of excellent
original hymns in addition to their translations. The
American Lutheran Hymnal contains nine of these by the
former and seventeen from the pen of the latter. Cronenwett&rsquo;s
hymns are chiefly didactic, but occasionally he soars
to lyrical heights, as in &ldquo;Of omnipresent grace I sing.&rdquo;
Among Kretzmann&rsquo;s best efforts are &ldquo;Lead on, O Lord&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Praise and honor to the Father.&rdquo; A note of praise to the
Holy Trinity is heard in practically all of Kretzmann&rsquo;s
hymns.</p>
<p>The foremost translator of Swedish hymns is Ernst W.
Olson, office editor of Augustana Book Concern, Rock
Island, Ill. From his gifted pen we have received the English
version of such gems as Wallin&rsquo;s &ldquo;All hail to thee, O
blessed morn,&rdquo; &ldquo;From peaceful slumber waking,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jerusalem,
lift up thy voice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mute are the pleading lips of Him,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Heavenly Light, benignly beaming&rdquo;; Franz&eacute;n&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ajar
the temple gates are swinging,&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, O Jesus, and prepare
me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;When vesper bells are calling&rdquo;; S&ouml;derberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;In
the temple where our fathers,&rdquo; Geijer&rsquo;s &ldquo;In triumph our
Redeemer,&rdquo; Petri&rsquo;s &ldquo;Now hail we our Redeemer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thy
sacred Word, O Lord, of old,&rdquo; and Carl Olof Rosenius&rsquo;
&ldquo;With God and His mercy, His Spirit and Word.&rdquo; Olson
has also written a number of excellent original hymns, including
&ldquo;Mine eyes unto the mountains,&rdquo; &ldquo;Behold, by sovereign
grace alone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glorious yuletide, glad bells proclaim
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other translators of Swedish hymns include Claude W.
Foss, professor of history at Augustana College, Rock Island,
Ill.; Victor O. Peterson, formerly with the same institution,
<span class="pb" id="Page_467">[467]</span>
but now deceased; George H. Trabert, Lutheran pastor at
Minneapolis, Minn.; Augustus Nelson, Lutheran pastor at
Gibbon, Minn.; Olof Olsson, for many years president of
Augustana College, and August W. Kjellstrand, who until
his death in 1930 was professor of English at the same institution.
Among the finest contributions by Foss are translations
of Nystr&ouml;m&rsquo;s &ldquo;O Fount of truth and mercy,&rdquo; Hedborn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;With holy joy my soul doth beat,&rdquo; and Franz&eacute;n&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thy
scepter, Jesus, shall extend.&rdquo; Nelson has given us beautiful
renderings of Franz&eacute;n&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prepare the way, O Zion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Awake, the watchman crieth,&rdquo; and Wallin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jesus, Lord
and precious Saviour.&rdquo; Peterson is the translator of Arrhenius&rsquo;
&ldquo;Jesus is my friend most precious&rdquo; and Wallin&rsquo;s Advent
hymn, &ldquo;O bride of Christ, rejoice.&rdquo; Olsson, who was one
of the earliest translators of Swedish lyrics, has given us
Franz&eacute;n&rsquo;s communion hymn, &ldquo;Thine own, O loving Saviour,&rdquo;
and another on the Lord&rsquo;s Supper by Spegel, &ldquo;The
death of Jesus Christ, our Lord.&rdquo; Kjellstrand&rsquo;s version of
Hedborn&rsquo;s sublime hymn of praise, &ldquo;Holy Majesty, before
Thee,&rdquo; is one of the most successful efforts at converting
Swedish hymns into the English language. To these translators
should also be added the name of Anders O. Bersell,
for many years professor of Greek at Augustana College,
who gave poetic English form to Lina Sandell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jerusalem,
Jerusalem&rdquo; and Rutstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come, Saviour dear, with us
abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of translators and writers besides those here
named made new contributions to the Hymnal of the Augustana
Synod published in 1925.</p>
<p>About twenty-five years ago a group of literary men within
the Norwegian Lutheran Synods undertook the task of
translating some of the gems of Danish and Norwegian
<span class="pb" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
hymnody. Among these were C. Doving, now a city missionary
in Chicago; George T. Rygh, also residing at the present
time in Chicago; C. K. Solberg, pastor of St. Paul&rsquo;s Lutheran
Church, Minneapolis, Minn.; O. T. Sanden, and O. H.
Smedby, former Lutheran pastor at Albert Lea, Minn., now
deceased. Doving&rsquo;s masterpiece undoubtedly is his translation
of Grundtvig&rsquo;s &ldquo;Built on the Rock, the Church doth
stand,&rdquo; although he will also be remembered for his rendering
of Holm&rsquo;s &ldquo;How blessed is the little flock,&rdquo; and Landstad&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Before Thee, God, who knowest all.&rdquo; Rygh&rsquo;s contribution
consists of the translation of such hymns as Grundtvig&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Peace to soothe our bitter woes,&rdquo; Kingo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Our table
now with food is spread,&rdquo; Landstad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Speak, O Lord, Thy
servant heareth,&rdquo; Boye&rsquo;s &ldquo;O Light of God&rsquo;s most wondrous
love,&rdquo; and Brun&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heavenly Spirit, all others transcending.&rdquo;
Sanden has translated Brun&rsquo;s &ldquo;The sun has gone down,&rdquo;
while Smedby has left us a fine version of Boye&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abide with
us, the day is waning.&rdquo; While Solberg has translated some
hymns, he is known better as a writer of original lyrics.
Among these are &ldquo;Lift up your eyes, ye Christians,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fellow
Christians, let us gather,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O blessed Light from
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foremost among recent translators of Danish hymns are
J. C. Aaberg, pastor of St. Peter&rsquo;s Danish Lutheran church,
Minneapolis, Minn., and P. C. Paulsen, pastor of Golgotha
Danish Lutheran church, Chicago, Ill. In the American
Lutheran Hymnal there are nineteen translations by Aaberg,
while Paulsen is represented by a like number. Through the
efforts of these men, both of whom possess no mean poetic
ability, many of the finest hymns of Brorson, Kingo, Grundtvig,
Ingemann, Vig, and Pawels have been introduced to
American Lutherans. Paulsen is the author of three original
<span class="pb" id="Page_469">[469]</span>
hymns, &ldquo;Blest is he who cries to heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;Take my heart,
O Jesus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let us go to Galilee,&rdquo; while Aaberg has
written &ldquo;There is a blessed power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most richly endowed hymn-writers in the
Lutheran Church today is A. F. Rohr, pastor at Fremont, O.
From his pen we have received such hymns as &ldquo;Eternal God,
omnipotent,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord of life and light and blessing,&rdquo; &ldquo;From
afar, across the waters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Living Fountain, freely flowing.&rdquo;
For poetic expression and graceful rhythm his hymns
are unsurpassed by any contemporary writer. He also combines
such depth of feeling with the lyrical qualities of his
hymns, they no doubt possess enduring qualities. Witness the
following hymn:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Living Fountain, freely flowing</p>
<p class="t">In the sheen of heaven&rsquo;s day,</p>
<p class="t0">Grace and life on us bestowing,</p>
<p class="t">Wash Thou all our sins away.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fountain whence alone the living</p>
<p class="t">Draw the life they boast as theirs,</p>
<p class="t0">By Thy grace, a gift whose giving</p>
<p class="t">Life of life forever shares.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Who Thy mighty depths can measure?</p>
<p class="t">Who can sound, with earthly line,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy profundity of treasure,</p>
<p class="t">Thy infinity divine?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They who quaff Thy wave shall never</p>
<p class="t">Thirst again; for springing free</p>
<p class="t0">In their hearts, a fount forever</p>
<p class="t">Thou to them of life shall be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">May we drink of Thee rejoicing,</p>
<p class="t">Till on heaven&rsquo;s sinless shore</p>
<p class="t0">We Thy virtues shall be voicing</p>
<p class="t">With the blest for evermore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_470">[470]</div>
<p>Samuel M. Miller, dean of the Lutheran Bible Institute,
Minneapolis, Minn., is the writer of a number of spiritual
songs and hymns that have become popular in Bible conference
circles. Among his hymns are &ldquo;In the holy Father&rsquo;s
keeping&rdquo; and &ldquo;When Jesus comes in glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>W. H. Lehmann, superintendent of home missions in the
American Lutheran Church, has written &ldquo;Take Thou my
life, dear Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beneath Thy cross I stand,&rdquo; the latter
a passion hymn of rare beauty:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Beneath Thy cross I stand</p>
<p class="t">And view Thy marr&egrave;d face;</p>
<p class="t0">O Son of man, must Thou thus die</p>
<p class="t">To save a fallen race?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Alone Thou bear&rsquo;st the wrath</p>
<p class="t">That should on sinners fall,</p>
<p class="t0">While from Thy holy wounds forthflows</p>
<p class="t">A stream of life for all.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lamb of God so meek,</p>
<p class="t">Beneath Thy cross I bow:</p>
<p class="t0">Heart-stricken, all my sins confess&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">O hear, forgive me now!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Son of God, look down</p>
<p class="t">In mercy now on me</p>
